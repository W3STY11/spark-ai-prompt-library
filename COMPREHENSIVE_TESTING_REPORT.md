## 🐛 ISSUES FOUND

### Issue #1: API Server Cached Code

**Description**: Initial prompt submission failed with "tags.split is not a function"
**Root Cause**: API server was running cached code that didn't handle array/string flexibility
**Resolution**: Restarted API server with `npm run api`
**Prevention**: Implement nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes

### Issue #2: Screenshot Timeouts
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: ⚠️ Known Limitation
**Description**: Full-page screenshots timeout waiting for fonts to load
**Root Cause**: Playwright waiting indefinitely for web fonts
**Impact**: Testing not affected, screenshots captured before timeout
**Workaround**: Use viewport screenshots or increase timeout
