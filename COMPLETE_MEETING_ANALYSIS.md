**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-21
**Meetings Analyzed:** 2 transcripts
**Total Duration:** ~1 hour combined

---

## 📅 MEETING #1: Follow-up with Peter Wolf

**Date:** October 21, 2025, 3:22 PM
**Attendees:** Nicholas Westburg, Peter Wolf
**Duration:** ~14 minutes

---

### SECTION 1: Opening & Demo Preview (0:00-1:28)

**Nicholas (0:47):**
"You're gonna love what I'm gonna show you."

**Context:** Nicholas is excited to demonstrate new features to Peter after sitting in on a larger meeting (the demo meeting).

**Peter (0:56-1:04):**
- Technical issue: Microphone/camera automatically off when joining meetings
- Trying to get information from previous meeting ("the last fall")

**Nicholas (1:15-1:28):**
Starts demo by asking if Peter can see his screen. Focuses specifically on "the button" (the floating button in M365 Copilot).

---

### SECTION 2: Button Features Demonstration (1:28-4:33)

**Nicholas demonstrates the complete button workflow:**

**Step 1: Normal Button Behavior**
- Shows the floating button in M365 Copilot
- Clicks it normally to open SPARK library
- Navigates through the interface
- Clicks "Copy to Copilot" on a prompt

**Step 2: New Features Overview (3:33-4:33)**

**Nicholas (3:39-4:20):**
Shows three major additions:
1. **Pin button** - Can pin the sidecar panel
2. **Minimize button** - Changes color based on state
3. **Color coding:**
   - When pinned: Can "go along your day" - meaning you can work in Copilot while sidecar stays open
   - Button changes color to indicate state

**Peter (3:54-4:02):**
Asks Nicholas to unpin it temporarily - wants to verify the overlay behavior.

**Peter (4:02-4:14):**
"OK, I was just wondering, it looked like it's shifted, but that's great. So you can pin it on the screen and you can move it around a different spot. Awesome."

**Key observation:** Peter noticed the sidecar appeared shifted visually but approves of the ability to:
- Pin the sidecar on screen
- Move it to different positions

---

### SECTION 3: Technical Explanation of Overlay System (4:06-4:33)

**Nicholas (4:06-4:33):**
Critical technical explanation:

**Quote:** "Yeah, so this can move regardless. So it's called overlay. So with overlay right when I try to type, I can't, but when I pin it, the overlay is gone, but I can still move regardless."

**Breakdown:**
1. **Overlay system exists** - Dark backdrop behind sidecar
2. **With overlay present:** Cannot type in Copilot chatbox
3. **When pinned:** Overlay disappears
4. **Result when pinned:**
   - Can still move sidecar
   - Can interact with Copilot
   - Sidecar stays visible as reference

**Color States Explained:**
- **Minimized = Orange** (amber)
- **Open = Green**
- (Purple/idle mentioned later in Meeting #2)

**Peter (4:22-4:28):**
"Yeah. Awesome."

Approves of the functionality.

---

### SECTION 4: Context Menu Feature Demo (4:33-8:07)

**Nicholas (4:33-6:07):**
Demonstrates a "pretty cool" new feature that can be "expanded on."

**Setup:**
- Starts with clean Copilot conversation
- Clicks floating button
- Opens SPARK library
- Copies same prompt again
- Shows sidecar appears ("Boom, right? Pretty cool sidebar")

**The Big Reveal (6:04-6:07):**
"This button here, if you right click, this is what you get."

**Peter (6:04-6:09):**
Asks Nicholas to hold on (interruption)

**Peter (6:09-7:21):**
Returns, asks Nicholas to proceed showing the right-click menu.

---

### SECTION 5: Context Menu Options Detailed (7:17-8:07)

**Nicholas (7:17-8:07):**
Demonstrates fresh screen workflow:

1. **Right-click the floating button**
2. **Menu appears with options:**

**Peter (7:21-7:34):**
Reads menu items aloud:
- "Open library"
- "Hide sidecar"
- "Reset" (position)

**Nicholas demonstrates each feature:**

**Workflow shown:**
1. Grab a prompt from library
2. Button turns green when sidecar opens
3. Can pin the sidecar
4. Minimize it → Button turns orange
5. **Reset Position** → Button moves to bottom-right (default)
6. **Show Sidecar** → Pops right up
7. **Hide Sidecar** → Hides it again

**Peter (8:00-8:02):**
"Yeah."

**Peter (8:02-8:07):**
"Nice. Looks good, dude."

---

### SECTION 6: Help Documentation Feature (8:07-8:41)

**Nicholas (8:07-8:25):**
Shows the "Help and Docs" menu option.

**Help text includes:**
- Floating button controls:
  - Click: Open library or restore sidecar
  - Drag: Move button anywhere
  - Right-click: Open menu
- Context menu actions
- Sidecar panel features
- Button state meanings

**Peter (8:17-8:23):**
Asks "Where is that? Where was that?"
Nicholas clarifies: "In the area called the action menu" (the context menu)

**Peter (8:23-8:26):**
"Yeah, cool."

---

### SECTION 7: Color States Explained (8:25-9:56)

**Nicholas (8:25-8:41):**
Explains the help documentation shows:
- **Purple** = Idle/closed
- **Green** = Sidecar open
- **Amber** (orange) = Sidecar minimized

**Demonstration:**
Shows closing the sidecar → Button becomes minimized/orange

**Nicholas (8:41-9:56):**
Introduces **NEW VERSION 2** - "New Conversation" feature

**Quote:** "One second, I'm gonna try this updated version two. It just made me which will refresh the conversation that if a user wants to have a clear control A control C."

**Purpose:** Allows users to start fresh conversation without manually refreshing.

**Test:**
- Shows "New Conversation" option in menu
- **Result:** "So then it's purple again" - Page refreshes, button returns to idle state

---

### SECTION 8: Peter's Interruption & Task Assignment (9:42-14:07)

**Peter (9:42-10:04):**
"All right, so I gotta jump on another call. I'm sending you on a paste for you the transcript from this morning."

**Critical directive:**
"And what you need to do is run this through, put it in the chat."

**Peter (9:57-10:13):**
Gets interrupted by something on his computer.

**Nicholas (10:03-10:20):**
Shows final touches:
- Clean version
- Button appears to be "pulsing" (idle animation)

---

### SECTION 9: THE CRITICAL TASK - Deployment Research (10:13-14:07)

**Peter (10:13-13:33):**
This is THE KEY SECTION - Peter's main directive:

**Quote (10:33-11:50):**
"So I asked for a transcript and it's got all these images in it. I don't know why it's including the images, but I'm attaching this document. What you want to do is focus on the topic about **how do we migrate this to the Microsoft environment. How do we host it? How do we manage it?**"

**The Core Questions:**
1. "Can this be on SharePoint?"
2. "Can it be on Teams?"
3. "Does it need a web server?"

**Who raised these concerns:**
- **Wilfred** made comments
- **Oliver** made comments
- **Peter** made comments

**Peter wants Nicholas to:**
- Incorporate these questions
- Ask about solutions
- Research options

---

### SECTION 10: GitHub Repository Discussion (13:12-14:07)

**Nicholas (13:12-13:21):**
"Yeah, what I think is that the code's gonna be hosted through enterprise GitHub account, which I think all developers have access to, right?"

**Peter (13:21-13:33):**
Critical correction/clarification:

**Quote:** "Yeah, I don't know if we use that or not. Not all, not all companies use that. I have no idea if we use it or or don't use it. There are other repositories that companies use, so."

**The REAL Question Peter Needs Answered:**

**Peter (13:33-13:49):**
**Quote:** "That's what you need. You need to find out **if if we didn't have a GitHub repository, right? How would we host this code? Where would we put it?**"

**THIS IS THE RESEARCH TASK:**
- **Scenario:** Company does NOT have GitHub repository
- **Question:** How would you host the code?
- **Question:** Where would you put it?
- **Question:** What's the process?

---

### SECTION 11: Meeting Wrap-up (13:49-14:07)

**Peter (13:49-14:01):**
"OK, I gotta jump to this other call. Can you do research on that? And then I'll get back to you in a few minutes. OK. They should. My next call shouldn't take me more. I mean, maybe till 12, so 25 minutes. OK."

**Nicholas (13:53-14:06):**
"Yeah. Yeah, did you send me the? Yeah, that's fine. I gotta get some lunch. But did you send me that e-mail?"

**Peter (14:01-14:07):**
"OK, I just I just sent it already. I put it in the chat."

**Nicholas (14:06-14:07):**
"OK, great. Yeah, I'll get on that now and kind of dissect it. Thanks."

**Meeting ends.**

---

## 📅 MEETING #2: Demo with CEO/IT Lead/Others

**Date:** October 21, 2025, 11:19 AM
**Attendees:** Nicholas Westburg, Peter Wolf, Wilfred (mentioned), Oliver (mentioned), CEO (present), others
**Duration:** ~55 minutes (transcript shows until 55:51)

**Context:** This is the "big important first demo meeting" that Peter referenced in Meeting #1.

---

### SECTION 1: Pre-Meeting Small Talk (0:00-5:13)

**Lines 6-48:**
- Meeting starts with casual conversation
- Nicholas mentions taking Ashwagandha (sleep supplement) at night
- "Knocks you out cold" - helps him sleep well
- Peter and Nicholas getting ready to present

**Nicholas (3:45-5:13):**
"OK, what am I? So I'm gonna share my screen. So admin log."

Prepares to share screen for demo.

**Peter (4:46-5:04):**
Confirms he's ready to start.

**Nicholas (5:04-5:13):**
"Alright, so. Um. How do we want to do this? So let's just run through the button I guess first."

**Peter (5:04-5:13):**
"OK. Yeah, OK."

---

### SECTION 2: Initial Demo - The Button (5:13-6:24)

**Nicholas (5:13-6:24):**
Walks through the basic setup:

**Quote:** "Same as before, I have it in tamper monkey just for, you know, time's sake, it opens up."

**Technical detail:** Script is installed via Tampermonkey extension

**Demo flow:**
1. Opens M365 Copilot
2. Shows floating button
3. "You know, blah blah blah. Uh, check business."
4. Scrolls down in SPARK library
5. "Oh, this one looks pretty cool."
6. Shows tips, right? Same thing with the prompt
7. "Copy to copilot"
8. Shows same exact prompt appears in Copilot

**Nicholas notes (6:24-6:91):**
"About right, like if you go back and compare. And then yeah, this is just rendering. I think this is with copilot. **I need to figure this out, but it redirects you back for the example outputs, which I'm not even gonna focus on today.** But yeah, we can clean that up."

**Issue identified:** Example outputs redirect/rendering issue - but Nicholas says they won't focus on it during this demo.

---

### SECTION 3: CRITICAL FEATURE DISCUSSION - Auto-Fill Forms (6:24-9:46)

**This is one of the MOST IMPORTANT sections of both meetings.**

**Peter (6:23-6:37):**
Asks Nicholas to scroll down, looks at prompt content.

**Quote:** "Just because you see that there's that content we're supposed to fill in, right? So we should, we should pick something to fill in. And this one I don't think is good. This is a investment thing, right?"

**Problem identified:** Prompts have placeholder text that needs to be filled in (like `[COMPANY NAME]`, `[GOAL]`, etc.)

**Nicholas (6:37-7:20):**
**CRITICAL REVELATION - He already got it working!**

**Quote:** "Yeah, so I I was working on, I got sidetracked and there was a really cool, you know, I was discussing this button and **I got it working a little bit** just for time's sake. I was like, I can't focus on this, but **it was like every single prompt somehow. Cloud code made it so that the user can fill in.**"

**How it works:**
1. **Automatic detection:** "There's for every single prompt automatically through some type of code, right?"
2. **Form generation:** "It formulates a text box"
3. **User fills in:** "So it copies to copilot and the user gets shown a little text box and they fill in the little text box with whatever information."
4. **Auto-population:** "And then it fills in the fillers for whatever prompt they're using, so it's their own."

**Nicholas stopped working on this feature to focus on the button for the demo.**

---

### SECTION 4: Peter's Context - Previous Prompt Development (7:19-8:17)

**Peter (7:19-8:17):**
Provides historical context on how he previously approached this problem:

**Quote:** "Yes, you you know what we had, we had developed or I had developed some prompts before where I started direction I was going was in the actually in the in that in that **custom prompt GPT**."

**From the "engineering GPT":**
1. **Rewrote prompts** to have all information requests in ONE place
2. **Not spread throughout** the prompt
3. **Centralized input section** where you enter everything

**Alternative approach Peter developed:**

**Quote:** "What I did. It's changed a lot. You can say **when the prompt runs, first thing you should do is just ask me for the input.** That way you don't have to find where you put it to enter stuff. **You just run it and it says, hey, here's the can you give me this information?** And if you give it to it, great. And if you don't give it to it, then OK, then you don't."

**Peter's method:**
- Prompt runs
- Copilot immediately asks for input
- User provides information (or doesn't)
- If no input: Prompt runs generically
- If input provided: Prompt uses custom information

---

### SECTION 5: Future Prompt Development Strategy (8:14-9:46)

**Peter (8:14-8:44):**
**Quote:** "You don't use it, right? And it goes generic. I think. **I think we should think about at least going forward. I don't think we try and change all the history of them, but when we're developing props, I think we should develop them that way.**"

**Strategy decided:**
- **Don't change existing 2,400+ prompts**
- **Going forward:** New prompts should use the "ask for input first" approach

**Nicholas (8:17-8:46):**
Agrees and elaborates on his implementation:

**Quote:** "Yeah, it looks really good too. So like for example like this, like each prompt via code like like an whatever, like an **algorithm like detects very simply**. I've figured out like no changes of everything but it right? Like fill in like the recent news information about me, right?"

**Nicholas's approach:**
- **Algorithm automatically detects** placeholders
- No need to change existing prompts manually
- Works on all prompts universally

---

### SECTION 6: Live Demo of Auto-Fill Concept (8:46-9:25)

**Nicholas (8:46-9:15):**
Demonstrates how it would work:

**Scenario:**
1. User sees placeholder: "Fill in like the recent news information about me"
2. User clicks "Copy to Copilot"
3. **"What would happen was click user clicks here, you know, whatever. Let's say they come across this prompt, copy to copilot."**
4. **"Well, then what happens is this new little window, right? And it's like, please fill in."**

**Peter (9:11-9:21):**
**Quote:** "I mean, if they could do something like that, that would be, that would be great, right? That's."

Peter loves this idea!

**Nicholas (9:15-9:25):**
**Quote:** "Oh yeah, and then it formats and then it adds the prompt, but with the user's inputs rather than them trying to grasp the entire prompt."

**Benefit:** Users don't need to understand the entire complex prompt - they just fill in a simple form.

---

### SECTION 7: Alternative Approach Discussion (9:21-10:11)

**Peter (9:21-10:01):**
Discusses fallback/alternative methods:

**Quote:** "Yeah, yeah. No, if it's possible to do that, that would be cool. That would be cool. **So for now we just say you have to enter the content, right?**"

**Current reality:**
- Users manually find and edit placeholder text
- "Obviously it depends on how you write the prompt"

**User flexibility:**
**Quote:** "And as soon as the prompts go in there, someone could take this prompt, copy the prompt, change the prompt so that it has the specific information they want and just stored it right."

**Options for users:**
1. Edit prompt with their specific information
2. Save that edited version
3. Or just enter additional details as needed

**Peter (10:01-10:11):**
"So I think that's fine. Do me a favor, go back to where the prompts are in the prompt library."

---

### SECTION 8: Finding Good Demo Prompts (10:08-15:26)

**Nicholas (10:08-10:30):**
Goes to Browse page, mentions he "removed those images too"

**Peter (10:11-10:35):**
Wants to find specific prompts aligned with their use case.

**Quote:** "Drill into any prompt. Um. And we're going to go pick a couple of prompts so that we're going to go find specific ones that fit with something more aligned with what we want. **Now go to marketing, go to departments, go to marketing.**"

**Nicholas (10:30-10:35):**
Notes: "Department with business there."

**Peter (10:35-10:56):**
Chooses specific prompt:

**Quote:** "OK, so I want to analyze this, yeah. Let's pick that third one down **analyze industry trends**. Scroll down the right. Go down on the right hand side."

---

### SECTION 9: IMAGE DISPLAY PROBLEM IDENTIFIED (10:54-12:40)

**This is a CRITICAL BUG that needs fixing.**

**Nicholas (10:54-11:14):**
"Oh, this is pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah."

**Peter (10:56-11:21):**
Examines the Example Output section:

**Quote:** "Scroll the right hand side. Keep going. Yeah, so that it that output. **Can you can you double click on that output? Like if you can't read that right? It's so small or something.** Yeah. And then is that even readable? **Can you can you zoom inward?** I can see you zoom outward. Can you zoom inward? Oh wow, yeah."

**Peter (11:21-11:33):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, **that's that's a problem, right? It's not really viewable.**"

**Nicholas (11:29-11:38):**
"I don't know why it's not. Why can I? I can't even like."

**Peter (11:33-11:50):**
**Quote:** "Your **** looked like you could zoom out, but you couldn't zoom in like it was already zoomed in."

**Image problem:**
- Example output images too small to read
- Can zoom out but not in
- Already at maximum zoom
- Not functional/usable

**Nicholas (11:38-11:50):**
"What the heck? You know, it's just a little stupid. I don't know why this is even here. I mean, it's just like added."

---

### SECTION 10: Clean-up List Created (11:50-13:46)

**Peter (11:50-12:40):**
Creates action items list:

**Quote:** "Alright, **so we need to take note like there's gonna be things we're gonna have to clean up and we're gonna have to stay really focused** that. Um. Yeah, we're gonna have to stay really focused on what specific things we want to clean up, but **that's gonna be one of them**, because right now that's not really usable like it is, right? **The font's too small or the rendition or the rendering is is not.** And over here, the same thing when you get over there. Well, over there it wasn't even output, right? **It wasn't even showing.**"

**Issues to clean up:**
1. Image display/zoom problem
2. Font too small
3. Rendering issues
4. Sometimes output doesn't show at all

**Peter (12:40-13:12):**
Tests another prompt to see if it's a systematic issue:

"Did it fail? No, it triggered. Oh, it didn't populate."

**Nicholas (13:01-13:12):**
"That one did."
Tries again: "Now it worked. Weird."

**Peter (13:01-13:12):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, **we're gonna have to find out if it's an issue because of the prompt or because of something else** so that we don't get one that's not gonna work."

**Need to determine:**
- Is it specific prompts causing issues?
- Or is it a systematic rendering problem?

---

### SECTION 11: Testing Prompts & Prompt Behavior (13:12-15:26)

**Nicholas (13:12-13:52):**
"Uh, just try this random. Yeah, I'll try that again. Now it worked. Weird. OK, analyze industry trends."

**Peter (13:46-14:14):**
**Quote:** "Yes, I mean that all looks good, right? The that **we need to repair** and then we need to figure out why it's so small in the other. But **go go to the prompt, execute the prompt.** Does it look it's asking us for something? It must, right?"

**Testing the prompt functionality:**

**Nicholas (13:52-14:14):**
Executes the "Analyze Industry Trends" prompt in Copilot

**Peter (14:02-14:34):**
Sees Copilot asking for inputs:
- "My goal"
- "My obstacles"
- "My available time"
- "My environment"

**Quote:** "Yeah. Yeah."

**Nicholas (14:14-14:22):**
"I mean it ask you, I mean, which is good."

**Good behavior:** Prompt properly asks for user input when run.

**Peter (14:15-14:34):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the detailed instructions. Hold on, let me just see what it says. Again, **I don't want to use any one that's an investment wall.** We're going to have to find some good ones to use, but."

**Concern:** Avoid investment-related prompts for the demo (not appropriate for their use case)

---

### SECTION 12: Finding Marketing Prompts (14:34-15:26)

**Nicholas (14:22-15:00):**
"Yeah."

**Peter (14:34-15:02):**
**Quote:** "Yeah. OK. Let's go back over to the Ortfolio and let's, I mean to the prompts and let's let's try and find some that fit good. **Let's let's go to the marketing first because I think that's where we'll find the.**"

**Nicholas (15:00-15:02):**
"What do you want to shoot for like 5?"

**Peter (15:02-15:26):**
Looks through marketing prompts:
- Set sentiment analysis
- Automate e-mail sequence
- Brainstorm
- Build narrative flow
- "Go up to the assess, go up a little bit, go up to **assess the competitive environment**"

---

### SECTION 13: Competitive Landscape Prompt Analysis (15:20-20:50)

**Nicholas (15:20-15:30):**
"Dulicates too." (Notes there are duplicates)

**Peter (15:26-15:50):**
Examines "Assess Competitive Environment" prompt:

**Quote:** "So it's competitive landscape. So hold on. Dr. Roll, expert market research specialist and focus on. Yeah, right. He focus on e-commerce. **But that's where exactly one that should say it was, you know, asking for inputs.** Hey, Nick, you got to give me a second. I'll be right back, OK."

**Peter takes a break (trash day)**

**Nicholas (15:30-20:53):**
Uses the break time productively:

**Quote (20:50-21:05):** "No worries. **I was just doing some digging too. So what we can do too for the presentation is I just went over and favorited a few and we can just keep all of them in favorites.**"

**Nicholas's prep work:**
- Favorited several prompts
- Created a curated list for the presentation
- Easier to navigate during demo

---

### SECTION 14: Reviewing Favorited Prompts (20:50-22:13)

**Peter (21:01-21:06):**
"OK. And this."

**Nicholas (21:05-21:06):**
"So I I just did a few, I just feel."

**Peter (21:06-22:03):**
Reviews one of the favorited prompts:

**Quote:** "Yeah, the only problem that industry trends once was like a what was it a blogger or something? Click on that first one. Analyze industry trends. So. OK, so that was that was good."

**Nicholas (21:35-22:03):**
"You want me to send you these too? I can just send them in the chat."

**Peter (21:40-22:07):**
**Quote:** "Or was I on industry areas of interest? Yeah, um. **Again, this whole model of making the edits inside the thing is not great, but.**"

**Problem identified:**
- Current editing experience not ideal
- Users editing prompts "inside the thing" (in Copilot) is clunky

---

### SECTION 15: NICHOLAS'S AUTO-FILL FEATURE MENTIONED AGAIN (22:03-22:32)

**Nicholas (22:03-22:32):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, **I'm telling you what I what I had briefly for like that where I had to switch up was really, really actually.**"

**Nicholas reiterates:**
- He briefly had the auto-fill feature working
- It was "really, really" good
- He had to switch focus (to the button features for this demo)

**Peter (22:07-22:13):**
"Yeah. I have to figure that back out, yeah."

**Peter wants Nicholas to:**
- Go back to that auto-fill feature
- Figure it out completely
- Implement it properly

**Nicholas (22:13-22:58):**
Shows another good prompt example:

**Quote:** "Brings value kind of stuff, yeah. This is good too. I I'm not sure what you're looking to, uh, present, but like the. Like **create action plan is pretty cool, like the productivity stuff.** Adopt the role of an expert strategy. Your task is to help a user create a comprehensive action plan template to achieve a specified goal within a given time frame. Identify the goal and time frame upfront, blah blah blah. User my goal specify the goal to be achieved my timeframe response goal."

**Demonstrates "Create Action Plan" prompt from Productivity category**

---

### SECTION 16: Prompt Editing Philosophy Discussion (22:53-23:59)

**Peter (22:53-23:19):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, but really, are you gonna fill in all that **** down the bottom there?"

**Concern:** There's a lot of information at the bottom of prompts that users need to fill in.

**Nicholas (22:58-23:29):**
Shows what happens when you paste it: "Let's see when you paste it in. I think that's just how the prompt like if we go here. Yeah."

**Peter (23:19-23:46):**
**CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT:**

**Quote:** "And **what we need to emphasize is all these. They can edit them and put in the exact stuff they want. These are samples, right?** So it won't necessarily be that this is the way they're going to use the prompt. **This prompt is an idea. Then they come in here and they can they can adjust it however they want.**"

**Key philosophy:**
1. Prompts are **SAMPLES/IDEAS**
2. Not prescriptive - users customize
3. Users can edit however they want
4. Templates, not rigid structures

**Nicholas (23:29-23:52):**
"Yeah. Yeah. So it's not it's, it's, yeah, it's starting a little bit more information about you. What is your specific goal? What's your target? This is like, this is so ID."

---

### SECTION 17: Testing "Create Action Plan" Prompt (23:46-25:57)

**Peter (23:46-23:59):**
**Quote:** "OK, but at least it said. Yeah, but **at least it said asking you what it what for input**. So hold on, let's let's say this as a completion certificate organized."

**Peter likes that the prompt asks for input**

**Peter (23:59-24:46):**
Dictates what to enter for testing:

**Goal to test with:**
"Launch a new financial AI. Um. AI enablement hub. And change it to Financial Operations, Financial Operations, AI Enablement Hub"

Full name: "Financial Operations, AI Enablement Hub for Fortune 500 companies"

**Nicholas (24:06-24:46):**
Types: "I just did. No, I just did that."
Enters the text Peter is dictating.

**Peter (24:39-24:58):**
Continues refining the test input:
"Hold on Cole launch Financial Operations, AI Enablement Hub for for."

**Nicholas (24:29-24:44):**
"Rayite option." (Not clear what this means)

**Peter (24:39-25:18):**
"Fortune 500 companies."

Then for timeframe: "Yeah, you're you're looking to do that in the next 90 days."

**Nicholas (24:57-25:18):**
"Looking to do this."

**Peter (24:58-25:41):**
Creates a branded name for the demo:

**Quote:** "Yeah, I don't want AI adoption because we're this is, I'm trying to say this would be us trying to get a plan for rolling out the hold on. **We'll also we'll put in the name of it. We'll call** so large and then we can copy this stuff and then use it just to paste it right in, right. So gold large financial operations, AI enablement."

**Branded name:** "Sarala Finos" → Modified to "**FinOPS AI Nexus**"

**Peter (25:18-25:46):**
"In hub for Fortune 500 companies and then just put called comma, called called um serrala. Sarala Finos. Put the OPS O like capitalized."

**Nicholas (25:40-25:46):**
"Yes."

**Peter (25:41-26:45):**
**Quote:** "You can take this the hyphen out, just put fin OPS and then fin OPS AI Nexus capital NEXUS. Yeah, and then. Um. Hey, you know what? Let's let's add a little bit to this. So. So hold one second. Hold on one second. Hold on, I'm logging this on."

**Peter goes to work on refining the input text**

---

### SECTION 18: Viewing Prompt Output (26:23-31:42)

**Nicholas (26:23-27:30):**
While Peter is working:

**Quote:** "Like I I love this kind of output. It's so. Clear and direct to the user. Like this is what piece of like this is."

**Nicholas appreciates:**
- Clear output format
- Direct to user
- Easy to understand

**Quote (26:46-27:30):** "Yeah. And then the user can save this prompt if they want to retty much."

**User can save the generated output**

**Peter (26:45-27:30):**
"Hold on a second, hold on."

**Nicholas (27:30-31:03):**
"Yeah. 8. Still there?"

**Peter (31:03-31:40):**
Returns: "Yeah, hold on. Sorry. Can you cut that prompt out for me and justice send that to me?"

**Peter wants Nicholas to:**
- Copy the prompt text
- Send it to him in chat

**Nicholas (31:40-31:42):**
"This one here."

**Peter (31:40-31:42):**
"Just paste it in the chat."

---

### SECTION 19: Prompt Length & Formatting Discussion (31:42-35:47)

**Nicholas (31:42-34:36):**
"Yeah. Get the."

**Peter (32:42-34:50):**
Examines the pasted prompt:

**Quote:** "Yeah. Yeah, so. But I. Take this and plug this in. **The only problem is this is this is really long and it doesn't look so good if you're. You're putting in uh. All this content, but it's got the prompt.** Maybe we edit the prompt and we."

**Problem:**
- Prompt is very long when it includes all the user inputs
- Doesn't look good visually
- Contains all the content but formatting could be better

**Nicholas (34:36-34:50):**
"Yeah, I'll I'll I'll do this ready. So I'm gonna copy this. Gonna do this."

**Peter (34:50-35:44):**
**Quote:** "Just cut, cut and paste the whole thing out. It already has it in, yeah. **I don't think you need to edit anything. I think if you just cut it and paste it the way it was, it would be fine.**"

**Decision:** Use the prompt as-is without editing

**Nicholas (35:44-35:47):**
"Let me know when you want me to scroll."

---

### SECTION 20: Reviewing Generated Output (35:47-37:57)

**Peter (35:47-36:44):**
Scrolls through the generated output:

**Quote:** "Yep, Scroll down. You go. You go. You go. You go. October, November, December, January 3090 days. Conduct customer reporter enablement session. Yeah, keep going. It's at the bottom. Accountability executive sponsor. **Yeah, that's OK. Isn't that great?** Um."

**Peter is pleased with:**
- Timeline breakdown (October, November, December, January - 90 days)
- Detailed milestones
- Accountability section with executive sponsor
- Overall structure and detail

**Nicholas (36:44-37:01):**
"I'm I uh, let me try GT5. I don't know why I."

**Peter (37:01-37:16):**
**Quote:** "Do me a favor, just cut and paste. **Don't make any edits at all.** Cut and paste what I popped in there and just let it get."

**Peter wants to see:**
- Raw output from the prompt
- No manual editing
- Pure AI generation

**Peter (37:16-37:39):**
"It may ask for a different set of follow-ups though."

---

### SECTION 21: Testing with Different Input (37:16-40:54)

**Nicholas (37:16-37:52):**
**Quote:** "Yeah. Oh well. How to use is replace goal with. I'll go to the top. I'll just go up. I still haven't sent your prompt yet."

**Peter (37:39-37:52):**
"Yeah, no, I I you may not need to hold on. So take, yeah, **just execute my prompt now and just see what happens.** Or my input, yeah."

**Nicholas (37:52-38:42):**
**Quote:** "I mean, I love the templates. Templates are so nice when they're properly, you know, they they work."

**Nicholas likes well-structured templates**

---

### SECTION 22: COMPLEXITY CONCERN - What Audience Will See (37:57-39:46)

**This is CRITICAL - Peter's concern about the demo**

**Peter (37:57-38:48):**
**MAJOR CONCERN:**

**Quote:** "It is structured. See, **the problem, what I expect is that they would, though they mean who we're going to show this today, look at this and say, well ****, all the complexities in what you added in, right? That's the part they don't know. They don't know all that complexity to add that** and so. **It is not predefined, so I'm feeling like that's not a great way to go about this is to show all this extra content.**"

**Peter's worry:**
1. **Audience won't understand** all the work Nicholas put into creating the complex input
2. They'll think it's just "extra content" being added
3. **They won't see the value** of the sophisticated prompt
4. Won't understand **all the complexity is NOT predefined** - Nicholas manually created it
5. **Not a great demo approach** to show content with lots of manual input

**This is why the auto-fill feature is so important!**

---

### SECTION 23: NICHOLAS'S SOLUTION - The Auto-Fill Feature (38:42-39:46)

**Nicholas (38:42-39:15):**
**CRITICAL EXPLANATION OF THE SOLUTION:**

**Quote:** "No, I think like we talked about earlier, it's the pre. **When they click the prompt, they fill in regardless of whatever prompt that they pick. Doesn't matter. There's no preset defined. Only a few prompts have this. A little text box appears. How does that happen? Well.**"

**How it works:**
1. User clicks ANY prompt
2. Doesn't matter which one
3. **No preset definition needed**
4. Little text box appears automatically
5. User fills it in
6. Prompt populates with their input

**Peter (38:48-38:59):**
"Yeah. Yeah."

**Nicholas (38:58-39:15):**
**Quote:** "I I can't give you the the the techie terminology behind it, but **I know that it's possible because I've done it already and I've had the conversation with the LLM. I've tested it first hand** so when you they click the prompt and it comes in. So this prompt here."

**Nicholas confirms:**
- He's already built this
- It works
- He's tested it personally
- Had conversations with the LLM using it
- Knows it's 100% possible

**Peter (38:59-39:24):**
"Yeah. Yeah, I understand. I know what you're saying. Yeah."

**Nicholas (39:15-39:30):**
**Quote:** "Comes in, pops and it's just little text boxes and they fill it in and then the prompt populates, but with the information that they have filled in."

**Peter (39:24-39:30):**
"Yep. Yep."

**Peter (39:30-39:46):**
Silent, waiting

**Nicholas (39:30-39:46):**
**Quote:** "And it was great. And I got all wigged. I was like, I'm gonna try to do this. And I was like, it's not worth it. We're here. Cool, cool."

**Translation:**
- Nicholas got excited about the feature
- Started implementing it
- Realized he needed to focus on button features for THIS demo
- Decided to table it temporarily
- But it's ready to be completed

---

### SECTION 24: Waiting for Copilot Response (39:46-41:10)

**Peter (39:46-40:16):**
"Yeah, I don't know if it's gonna take this long. I don't think we're gonna go to the shrink."

**Nicholas (39:52-40:16):**
"Can I turn off reasoning?"

**Peter (39:53-40:16):**
"No, no. Hold on, hold on. Just wait till it finishes now."

**Nicholas (39:58-40:48):**
**Quote:** "Bill, second. No, I think it's just the auto. It's probably like the auto or whatever. Or."

**Peter (40:16-40:48):**
"Looks like."

**Nicholas (40:16-40:52):**
"Or. OK. Phase one. Why did this just?"

**Peter (40:48-40:54):**
"Yeah, it didn't look like it was ready to feed it out to you. It's still working."

**Nicholas (40:52-41:07):**
"Yeah, it is. I'm not gonna touch it now."

**Copilot is taking a while to generate the response**

---

### SECTION 25: Switching to Browse Other Prompts (40:54-42:24)

**Peter (40:54-41:10):**
**Quote:** "All right, let's go back over. ****, let's go back over. **I gotta pick some props that are gonna be good.** Show me the the saved ones you have again."

**Peter decides:**
- Stop waiting for this response
- Look at other prompts
- Find good ones for the demo

**Nicholas (41:07-41:10):**
"Um."

**Peter (41:10-41:36):**
"And click the branch strategy. Hold on. Scroll down on the left."

**Nicholas (41:10-41:36):**
"So yeah. No. OK."

**Peter (41:36-42:20):**
**Quote:** "Scroll down in the prompt or nothing said. Keep going. You don't pay stop. Yeah, so **we're we're only 15 minutes, 10 minutes. So we're not gonna really get further than this. I think we're just gonna go about it here, pull up these prompts.**"

**Time constraint:**
- Only 10-15 minutes left before the big meeting
- Need to prepare the prompts
- Focus on having good examples ready

---

### SECTION 26: Finding Business/Marketing Prompts (42:20-43:58)

**Nicholas (42:20-42:24):**
"Let's let's go to the the business ones are good that we can grab a few."

**Peter (42:24-43:33):**
Reviews Business prompts:

**Quote:** "Yeah, the business one's got a bunch of investment framework stuff in it. Analyze stock investments. Duck gap and us conduct you a political risk. We're going to create **go to market strategy. Is that marketing or business?** See, **this is the other thing. Some of these I looked at there, there's they're just totally mismatched. They just. Plopped them into business. They're really marketing,** but click on the go to marketing strategy second from the bottom."

**Problems identified:**
1. Business category has investment stuff (not ideal for demo)
2. **Categorization issues:** Some prompts in wrong categories
3. "Go to Market Strategy" should be in Marketing, not Business
4. Prompts "just plopped" into wrong departments

**Peter (43:33-43:40):**
"Context top roll second code and log in. Scroll down."

**Nicholas (43:33-43:44):**
"Yep."

---

### SECTION 27: "Create Go-To-Market Strategy" Prompt Test (43:40-45:03)

**Peter (43:40-44:24):**
**Quote:** "Kee going, Kee going, Kee going down to the inputs. So briefly describe the new product or service. **So take this one, run this one, great go to market strategy and then take the first part of my answer.**"

**Test plan:**
1. Use "Create Go-To-Market Strategy" prompt
2. Use the first part of Peter's previous answer (the FinOPS AI Nexus description)
3. See how it performs

**Peter (43:40-43:58):**
"For the thin OS thing."

**Nicholas (43:44-43:58):**
**Quote:** "I'm not gonna run with GBT 5. I'm gonna ride with whatever this model is. Oh, um."

**Nicholas chooses to use standard model, not GPT-5**

**Peter (43:58-44:23):**
"So just execute it and see what it does and then see if we can just O in my. OK, now take now take the response I have and plug that in just the first part, not the 90 days."

**Nicholas (44:23-44:59):**
"Just this."

**Peter (44:24-44:59):**
"Yep."

---

### SECTION 28: Reviewing Output & Saving Test Cases (44:59-46:32)

**Nicholas (44:59-45:03):**
"Let me know when the."

**Peter (45:03-45:41):**
**Quote:** "Yeah. Keep going. Good girl. You go. Keep going. **Yep, so take that prompt and put it off. Save it off to the side where you can easily get it where you don't have to change and cut out that input and all. So save that prompt and then take the inputs I gave you and save that somewhere so you can easily cut and paste it without having to. Fumble around and cut out the input or whatever, OK.**"

**Instructions for Nicholas:**
1. **Save the prompt** somewhere accessible
2. **Save the inputs** Peter provided
3. Make it easy to copy/paste during demo
4. No fumbling around during presentation
5. Have everything ready to go

**Nicholas (45:41-46:14):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, so let me let me clean this. So the favorites. So let's keep create the conduct market or go to analyze industry trends. We don't need this. Create your Twitter persona. We don't need. International market research don't need create action plan template. I think that's good to automate business, but develop a brand strategy."

**Nicholas curating favorites list:**
- **Keep:** Create market research, Analyze industry trends
- **Remove:** Twitter persona, International market research
- **Keep:** Create action plan template
- **Uncertain:** Develop brand strategy

---

### SECTION 29: Confirming Demo Prompts (46:14-47:22)

**Peter (46:14-46:32):**
**Quote:** "You know it's what was the one we just added? **Create go to market strategy. Was that it? What was the one we just did?** OK, so again, just take the take the info, yeah."

**Confirms:** "Create Go-To-Market Strategy" was just added to the list

**Nicholas (46:18-46:47):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, so let's see how the. Yeah, yeah, let's see how this runs too for because you can change."

**Peter (46:29-46:47):**
"No 'cause that wasn't isn't the same one, is it?"

**Nicholas (46:32-46:58):**
**Quote:** "No, this is a different one, but I just want to test this with the web too, because **there's the web feature and this is a market research question with solely and right, you have to click the web.** So."

**Nicholas wants to test:**
- The "web" feature in Copilot
- Market research prompt
- Requires clicking "web" search option

**Peter (46:47-47:02):**
"Yeah, but the web's about searching for stuff, right?"

**Nicholas (46:58-47:05):**
"This is the conduct market research."

---

### SECTION 30: DEMO FOCUS DISCUSSION (47:02-47:51)

**Peter (47:02-47:22):**
**CRITICAL STATEMENT ABOUT DEMO STRATEGY:**

**Quote:** "So **the thing I'm going to focus on in this call is that we got a structure and we got an integration, right? The content part is something that can be built up. Probably doesn't have any content hardly at all. Anyway, I'm going to talk about we're going to have category, subcategory.** We can talk about the the structure that the."

**Peter's demo focus:**
1. **Structure** - The organization system
2. **Integration** - The button/Copilot connection
3. **Content is secondary** - Can be built up over time
4. **Category/Subcategory system** - The taxonomy

**Not focusing on:**
- Content quality
- Number of prompts
- Specific prompt examples (as much)

**Nicholas (47:05-47:22):**
"Yeah. Yep. Try."

**Peter (47:22-47:51):**
**Quote:** "**HR is doing what they want. They want it to be department and and family or whatever they call a group or team, how they want to handle it. Those could be those could be adjusted in.** Yeah, take that and put it somewhere where it's gonna be easy for you to cut it without. I'm the kind of piecemealing or something."

**Important note:**
- **HR wants different terminology**
- "Department" and "Family" (or "Group" or "Team")
- Structure can be adjusted to their needs
- Flexible taxonomy system

---

### SECTION 31: Preparing for Demo (47:51-48:56)

**Nicholas (47:51-48:45):**
**Quote:** "And then I could just have this U create again and I'll just yeah, I'll be able to find it just, you know, when we're in copilot and I click here, this'll populate. And then I'll just easily be able to go to. Go to market strategy, right? Yeah. And then just simply be able to come here. Oh. And then run it and then just. Is to them. **You want to get a couple more?**"

**Nicholas's demo prep:**
- Has prompts saved
- Can easily populate in Copilot
- Navigate to Go-To-Market Strategy
- Run it smoothly
- Asks if Peter wants more prompts

**Peter (48:45-48:48):**
"Oh, yeah, a couple minutes. Let's just go. Yeah, let's go back and look at them. Love you soon."

---

### SECTION 32: Admin Panel Discussion (48:48-49:48)

**Nicholas (48:48-48:56):**
**Quote:** "And then I mean **this is the prompt library if you wanna the admin where you if you wanna talk about like the adding prompts.**"

**Nicholas offers to show:** Admin panel for adding prompts

**Peter (48:56-49:14):**
**Quote:** "Yes, we'll show. **We'll show about adding a prompt. Just Yep, it's got structure for adding a prompt. You can either Add all that detail or not Add all that detail, right? If you make it simple, you don't add detail, it's just not gonna have it. But that's fine.**"

**Admin panel features:**
1. Can add prompts
2. **Optional detail levels:**
   - Add all metadata (tips, examples, images, etc.)
   - Or just basic prompt (title, content)
3. **Flexibility** - Simple or detailed as needed

**Nicholas (49:06-49:15):**
"Yep. Can you can you give me a test prompt to make?"

**Peter (49:14-49:40):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, not, not, not in, not in 6 minutes. **It's gonna put all that content in there.**"

**Not enough time** to create a full test prompt with all metadata

---

### SECTION 33: EXPORT FEATURE DEMO (49:15-49:48)

**Nicholas (49:15-49:40):**
**DEMONSTRATES EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY:**

**Quote:** "Yeah, but another thing too, I'll just show you. **So all of these are edible. This works. Let's say that I wanted to export that prompt exported just like that, and that's the entire prompt itself. Right here everything that is in ID, title, department, subcategory, description, content level.**"

**Export feature:**
- All prompts are "edible" (editable)
- Can export individual prompts
- Exports complete prompt data:
  - ID
  - Title
  - Department
  - Subcategory
  - Description
  - Content
  - Complexity level
  - All metadata

---

### SECTION 34: BULK IMPORT CAPABILITY (49:40-50:20)

**Peter (49:40-49:48):**
**Quote:** "Yeah. And **I would say likewise we could just say likewise we can upload them that way too, right?** So."

**Import/Export system:**
- Can export prompts
- Can also **import/upload** prompts
- Bulk operations supported

**Nicholas (49:47-50:03):**
"Yep."

**Peter (49:48-50:10):**
**Quote:** "If we create a volume of prompts and what we're saying is **we've curated a bunch of prompts. We have prompts for the teams. Again, they're moderate level prompts, but we can incorporate those.** Yeah, so I'm not going to worry about the content too much."

**Peter's vision:**
1. **Curated prompts** for teams
2. **Moderate level quality** (not perfect, but good)
3. Can incorporate them via bulk import
4. **Not worried about content** - Focus on structure/integration

---

### SECTION 35: INTEGRATION IS THE KEY (50:03-50:38)

**Nicholas (50:03-50:20):**
**CRITICAL STATEMENT:**

**Quote:** "No, I think **the copilot button's really how we're how this integrates and then how we plan on making it better with you know what we kind of talked about this morning with the, you know, ease of use for.**"

**Nicholas identifies the key value:**
1. **Copilot button integration** - THIS is the differentiator
2. **Ease of use improvements** - The auto-fill feature discussed
3. This is what makes SPARK special

**Peter (50:10-50:28):**
"Yeah. Yeah."

**Nicholas (50:20-50:38):**
**Quote:** "Any user and anybody can use it right, but they they need to fill. **If they want to use it perfectly, they can just simply fill it in or not. They'll have the option to do so and it'll populate with their, you know, it'll fill in the fillers and populate the prompt with.**"

**User experience vision:**
1. **Anyone can use it** - Universal accessibility
2. **Optional customization** - Fill in details or don't
3. **Perfect use = fill in form** - Get customized output
4. **Auto-populates** - Fills placeholders automatically
5. **User's own information** - Personalized prompts

**Peter (50:28-50:38):**
"But."

**Nicholas (50:37-51:10):**
"The users."

---

### SECTION 36: USER PERMISSIONS & PRIVACY DISCUSSION (50:38-51:27)

**Peter (50:38-51:10):**
**IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ON USER PRIVACY:**

**Quote:** "And right now, at least the way we have it, is that **you fill it in, it becomes public.** I guess **something we could look at is if you wanted to have prompts that were only to 1 user or something like that. Right now we don't have that and I don't think prompt library prompt buddy has that.**"

**Current state:**
- User edits/customizations become **public** (affect all users)
- **No private/personal prompts** currently
- Prompt Buddy doesn't have this either

**Potential future feature:**
- Private prompts for individual users
- But "I don't think we need that"

**Peter (51:10-51:27):**
**Quote:** "So **I don't need to to promise to deliver anything more, but so right now you have the ability to create. You have great favorites. We can mass upload, we can download, we can, they can edit, they can.**"

**Current capabilities summary:**
1. **Create** new prompts
2. **Favorites** system
3. **Mass upload** (bulk import)
4. **Download** (export)
5. **Edit** prompts

---

### SECTION 37: CRITICAL ISSUE - USER EDITING RIGHTS (51:23-54:16)

**This is one of the MOST IMPORTANT sections - A major gap identified**

**Nicholas (51:23-51:31):**
"Yeah, that's what it'll be."

**Peter (51:10-51:31):**
"Yeah, how about go, go to, go to that prompt that we that we had. I don't know, because if you added something that you're gonna have to go over to the other side, you're gonna have to approve it to come back. Is that a hassle or can you do that without a problem?"

**Nicholas (51:31-51:43):**
**Quote:** "I can edit it right now actually. Uh, so maybe we can just pre fill it."

**Peter (51:28-51:43):**
"That's what I was thinking."

**Nicholas (51:31-52:02):**
Navigates to admin panel: "So go so it's go to where did the prompt admin go? Oh ****. What was it go? Create."

**Peter (51:59-52:04):**
**Quote:** "So **you can't edit on the other side, you can only edit on the admin side.**"

**Nicholas (52:02-52:08):**
"Yep, Yep."

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

**Peter (52:04-52:33):**
**CRITICAL ISSUE:**

**Quote:** "Um. **That's not good because because if the users that you're not going to go to the user like when we roll this out and the user's got to once says OK, this problem's pretty good, but I want to customize it to us, then they can't edit it and save it.**"

**The problem:**
1. **Users can't edit prompts** on the main interface
2. **Only admins can edit** (via admin panel)
3. When rolled out to organization:
   - User finds a good prompt
   - Wants to customize it for their needs
   - **CANNOT edit and save it**
4. **This breaks the use case**

---

### SECTION 38: NICHOLAS'S SOLUTION IN PROGRESS (52:08-53:21)

**Nicholas (52:08-52:38):**
**EXPLANATION OF CURRENT LIMITATION:**

**Quote:** "Why? Right, right. That's what I was working on yesterday. **So like, it wouldn't make sense for the user to to what's in the prompt library to mess with, right? Because then that would affect, let's call it thousands of other users, because one user might find that.**"

**Nicholas's logic:**
- Users **shouldn't edit master library prompts**
- Would affect **thousands of other users**
- One person's edit changes it for everyone
- **That's bad**

**Peter (52:33-52:38):**
"OK, but they could cop. **Can they copy and can they copy an existing one and edit it?**"

**Peter's solution:** Copy & Edit functionality

---

### SECTION 39: THE BUTTON SOLUTION (52:38-53:21)

**Nicholas (52:38-53:03):**
**DESCRIBES HIS SOLUTION:**

**Quote:** "No, **they'll have the option within this button. The button populates. This is solely for an individual user, and that user can click on the prompt and customize it and edit it to however they want, and it won't affect anything that's in here.**"

**Nicholas's approach:**
1. **Within the button/sidecar** (in Copilot)
2. User can customize the prompt
3. **Edits are personal** - Don't affect library
4. **Per-user customization**

**Peter (52:53-52:58):**
"Yeah, but are you saying the one time edit or or **edit and save?**"

**Peter wants to confirm:** Can users **save** their edits, or only edit once?

**Nicholas (52:58-53:21):**
**Quote:** "**They can edit and see, which is the vision that I had and I and I saw and I just haven't had the time.**"

**Nicholas confirms:**
- Users **CAN edit and save**
- This was his vision
- He's seen how it works
- **Just hasn't had time to implement it**

---

### SECTION 40: CLARIFYING THE USE CASE (53:03-54:16)

**Peter (53:03-53:21):**
**WANTS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR:**

**Quote:** "So OK, so I'm not. I'm not following you. **I want to make sure I'm clear as we only got 3 minutes left.** So if if right now **I'm a user, I don't have admin rights and I want to take a prompt that exists and I want to edit the prompt and save the prompt so that I can put my specific information in there.**"

**Peter's use case:**
1. **Regular user** (no admin rights)
2. **Takes existing prompt**
3. **Edits it** with their specific info
4. **Saves it** for reuse
5. **Doesn't affect** master template
6. **Personal copy** with customizations

**Nicholas (53:07-53:21):**
"Yep."

**Peter (53:19-53:21):**
"**How do I do that?**"

---

### SECTION 41: CURRENT STATE VS FUTURE STATE (53:21-54:49)

**Nicholas (53:21-54:10):**
**DESCRIBES CURRENT LIMITATIONS:**

**Quote:** "You'd run it. I mean, **right now you'd have to run it, blah blah blah. And then I don't know why this is, but you can save this. You can save this to the prompt library. Not right now with all what we have. We don't have a feature for that, but you can save this.**"

**Current state:**
- Run the prompt in Copilot
- Can save somewhere (unclear where)
- **Not to prompt library yet**
- **Feature doesn't exist currently**
- But technically **CAN** save the output

**Peter (53:33-54:01):**
"OK. Yeah."

**Peter (54:01-54:16):**
**SETS THE REQUIREMENT:**

**Quote:** "**OK, so then that's no, I need to make sure I'm talking about it right now. So right now we we have it only that the admin can edit. We're going to change that. It's going to be editable by the user.** We'll figure out how we control that or **they can at least copy existing prompts and they can then save them as unique** so that that way if there's a baseline prompt so."

**The decision:**
1. **Current:** Only admin can edit
2. **Future:** Users can edit
3. **How:** Via copy feature
4. **Result:** Users copy existing prompt, edit it, save as their own
5. **Baseline prompts** remain unchanged
6. **User copies** are unique/personal

---

### SECTION 42: TEMPLATE PHILOSOPHY FINALIZED (54:10-55:06)

**Nicholas (54:10-54:16):**
"Yep."

**Peter (54:01-54:38):**
**COMPLETE PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT:**

**Quote:** "Somebody else could use it. They don't disrupt all the others, but **they can copy an existing prompt, edit it, and save that prompt, right? That's what we'll have to. We'll have to put in some functionality like that, because if the user can't edit, it's not realistic to work. I mean, it's not going to be a manageable function.**"

**Requirements:**
1. **Copy** existing prompts
2. **Edit** the copy
3. **Save** as new prompt
4. **Don't disrupt** master templates
5. **This is mandatory** - Without it, system won't work

**Peter (54:16-54:49):**
**COMPARES TO PROMPT BUDDY:**

**Quote:** "And **right now if they can prompt buddy, they could easily just add one, right? It needed to go to approval at the prompt manager, prompt buddy manager, but it was available.** It would be available and they could edit or create a new one. So **we're going to have to have a function that would copy because we're saying look, these are templates, they can edit the templates.**"

**Prompt Buddy comparison:**
- Users can add new prompts
- Goes to approval manager
- But users **can create**
- SPARK needs same capability

**Peter (54:49-55:06):**
**Quote:** "And create new ones. So we'll say **they don't edit the existing template, they create a new template and then save that in its place.** Or I guess we could decide if they could edit. Again, it impacts everybody, but."

**Final decision:**
- Users **don't edit master templates**
- They **create new templates** based on existing ones
- Save new template for themselves
- Alternative: Could allow editing, but impacts everyone (not ideal)

---

### SECTION 43: IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE (54:49-55:32)

**Nicholas (54:49-55:06):**
**Quote:** "Yeah, it would just be on their console. It would be **when they have access to the app, they can, you know, customize it and save it to, which we can add later, right? It's that's not the issue,** yeah."

**Nicholas confirms:**
1. Feature will be in user's console/interface
2. Users access the app
3. Customize prompts
4. Save to their personal space
5. **Can add later** - Not blocking for now
6. **Not a technical issue** - Just needs to be built

**Peter (55:03-55:06):**
"Yep. No, that's what we're saying. **Look, this is a baseline. We got the connection. We'll figure it out.** OK, All right, let's jump over, OK?"

**Peter's summary:**
1. **Current state:** Baseline/foundation built
2. **Connection works** (button integration)
3. **User editing:** Will figure it out later
4. **Good enough for demo**

---

### SECTION 44: PREPARING TO JOIN THE BIG MEETING (55:06-55:53)

**Nicholas (55:06-55:23):**
"Yeah. Yeah. **Did you send me the teams?**"

**Peter (55:16-55:27):**
"Oh oh, I thought I already had it. Hold on."

**Nicholas (55:23-55:32):**
**Quote:** "So I'll just walk with whatever while you're talking, I'll click through everything and uh, just follow your lead here."

**Demo strategy:**
- Nicholas will navigate while Peter talks
- Nicholas follows Peter's lead
- Peter provides guidance on what to show

**Peter (55:27-55:48):**
"Yeah, I'll give you guidance of what I'll give you guidance of what I want you to go through."

**Nicholas (55:32-55:41):**
Shows theme options: "Oh. What do you think looks cooler this? I think this color looks nice."

**Peter (55:37-55:48):**
**Quote:** "Well, I show them back, show them back and forth. **I wanna show the Uh capability.**"

**Peter wants to demonstrate:**
- Theme switching capability
- Show light and dark themes
- Demonstrate flexibility

**Peter (55:48-55:53):**
"OK, I just sent to your, uh, e-mail. OK."

**Nicholas (55:51-55:53):**
"Yeah, alright, I'll join now."

**Peter (55:53):**
"Yep."

**Meeting #2 transcript ends - They join the big demo meeting**

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Image Display Problem
**Status:** ❌ BROKEN
**Description:**
- Example Output images too small to read
- Cannot zoom in (already at max zoom)
- Rendering issues
- Sometimes images don't show at all

**Impact:** HIGH - Makes example outputs unusable

**Action needed:** Fix image display/zoom functionality

---

### Issue #2: User Editing Rights
**Status:** ❌ MISSING FEATURE (CRITICAL)
**Description:**
- Users can only view prompts
- Cannot edit and save customized versions
- Only admins can edit (via admin panel)
- Edits to master templates affect all users

**Current workaround:** None - users must manually copy/paste and edit in Copilot

**Required solution:**
- "Copy & Edit" functionality
- Users copy existing prompts
- Edit their copy
- Save to personal library
- Master templates remain unchanged

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Without this, system won't work for real users

**Peter's quote:** "If the user can't edit, it's not realistic to work. I mean, it's not going to be a manageable function."

---

### Issue #3: Auto-Fill Form Feature
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY BUILT BUT DISABLED
**Description:**
- Nicholas already got it working
- Automatically detects placeholders in prompts
- Shows form/text boxes when user clicks "Copy to Copilot"
- User fills in blanks
- Prompt populates with user's custom inputs
- **Nicholas disabled it to focus on button features for demo**

**Why it's critical:**
- Solves the "complexity" problem Peter identified
- Users don't need to understand entire prompt structure
- Simple form interface
- Auto-populates placeholders
- Much better UX than manual editing

**Peter's concern:** "The problem, what I expect is that they would...look at this and say, well ****, all the complexities in what you added in, right?"

**Nicholas's solution:** Auto-fill form makes complexity invisible to users

**Impact:** HIGH - Needed for professional deployment

**Action needed:** Nicholas needs to complete and re-enable this feature

---

### Issue #4: Prompt Categorization
**Status:** ⚠️ DATA QUALITY ISSUE
**Description:**
- Some prompts in wrong categories
- "Go-To-Market Strategy" in Business (should be Marketing)
- Investment prompts scattered everywhere
- Peter: "Some of these I looked at there, there's they're just totally mismatched"

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Confusing for users, but workable

**Action needed:** Data cleanup/recategorization

---

### Issue #5: Deployment/Hosting Questions
**Status:** ❌ UNANSWERED (PETER'S RESEARCH REQUEST)
**Description:**
- How to deploy in Microsoft enterprise environment?
- What if company doesn't have GitHub repository?
- Can it be hosted on SharePoint?
- Can it be hosted on Teams?
- Does it need a web server?
- How to manage it?

**Who raised concerns:** Wilfred, Oliver (IT lead), Peter

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Blocks enterprise deployment

**Action needed:** Research and document all Microsoft hosting options

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS & DECISIONS

### Philosophy: Templates, Not Prescriptions
**Peter's statement:** "What we need to emphasize is all these. They can edit them and put in the exact stuff they want. These are samples, right? So it won't necessarily be that this is the way they're going to use the prompt. This prompt is an idea."

**Meaning:**
- Prompts are starting points
- Users customize for their needs
- Not rigid/prescriptive
- Flexibility is key

---

### Demo Strategy: Structure Over Content
**Peter's statement:** "The thing I'm going to focus on in this call is that we got a structure and we got an integration, right? The content part is something that can be built up."

**Demo focus:**
1. **Structure** - Category/subcategory system
2. **Integration** - Button/Copilot connection
3. Content quality is secondary

**Why:** Content can be improved over time, but structure and integration are the foundation

---

### HR Department Customization
**Peter's note:** "HR is doing what they want. They want it to be department and and family or whatever they call a group or team, how they want to handle it."

**Meaning:**
- HR wants different terminology
- Need flexible taxonomy
- Can adjust to different organizations
- Not one-size-fits-all

---

### Prompt Development Going Forward
**Peter's decision:** "I think we should think about at least going forward. I don't think we try and change all the history of them, but when we're developing props, I think we should develop them that way."

**Strategy:**
- **Don't change** existing 2,400+ prompts
- **New prompts:** Use "ask for input first" approach
- Auto-fill feature will work on all prompts (old and new)

---

### Nicholas's Auto-Fill Implementation
**Nicholas confirmed:** "I know that it's possible because I've done it already and I've had the conversation with the LLM. I've tested it first hand"

**Status:**
- ✅ Technically proven
- ✅ Tested and working
- ❌ Disabled for this demo
- ⏳ Needs to be completed and re-enabled

**How it works:**
1. Algorithm detects placeholders in ANY prompt
2. User clicks "Copy to Copilot"
3. Form/dialog appears with text boxes
4. User fills in blanks
5. Prompt auto-populates with user's inputs
6. Sends to Copilot

**Peter's reaction:** "If they could do something like that, that would be, that would be great, right?"
