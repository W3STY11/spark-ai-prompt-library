========================================
YOUR BROWSER HAS OLD CACHED FILES!
========================================

The server is serving the NEW code, but your browser
is showing you the OLD JavaScript from cache!

DO THIS RIGHT NOW:
========================================

1. HARD REFRESH the page:
   - Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R

2. If that doesn't work, CLEAR CACHE:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. If STILL doesn't work:
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   - Check "Cached images and files"
   - Time range: "All time"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Close and reopen the browser

4. VERIFY it worked:
   - Open the page
   - Press F12
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for "main-tUXKKZkZ.js"
   - It should say "(disk cache)" or "200" status
