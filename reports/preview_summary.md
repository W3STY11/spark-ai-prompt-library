## Deployment Status: FAILED ‚ùå

Both deployments failed with the same error:

**Error:** "The size of the app content was too large. The limit for this Static Web App is 524288000 bytes."

### Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow build script (`scripts/build-index.mjs`) tries to read from `/home/aiwithnick/AI Prompts v5_BACKUP`, which doesn't exist in the GitHub runner environment. This causes:
1. Build produces 0 prompts (see warning: "Total prompts: 0")
2. Build tries to copy files from non-existent directory
3. Total size still exceeds 500 MB limit

### Solution Required
The `public/prompts_index.json` file needs to be committed to the repository (currently in .gitignore).

**Workflow runs:**
- Dev staging: https://github.com/W3STY11/spark-ai-prompt-library/actions/runs/18729756682
- PR preview: https://github.com/W3STY11/spark-ai-prompt-library/actions/runs/18729773987

### Next Steps
1. Remove `public/prompts_index.json` from .gitignore
2. Commit the existing `prompts_index.json` file to the repository
3. Update build script to skip index generation if file already exists
4. Retrigger the workflow

**Note:** This is a blocker for PR preview deployment. Cannot test card tightening changes until this is resolved.
