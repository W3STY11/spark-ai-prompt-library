Nicholas Westburg 0:19
But.

[]
2:12
Hey.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 2:15
Hi.

[]
Peter Wolf 2:16
All right, let's see what we got.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:09
It's uh.
Too much.
You know what I've been taking at night? Have you heard of ashwagandha?

[]
Peter Wolf 3:26
What are you saying?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:28
Ashwaganda. It's like you buy from like CVS or Walmart. I guess it's
like a melatonin, man. It knocks you out cold, knocks you out cold. I
would get like really, really good sleep. I'm not saying it's like a
good thing, but.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:30
No, who's that?
Done.
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:45
OK, what am I? So I'm gonna share my screen.
So admin log.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:46
the It the

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:56
Alright, so.
Um.
How do we want to do this? So let's just run through the button I guess
first.

[]
Peter Wolf 5:04
OK.
Yeah, OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 5:13
Same as before, I have it in tamper monkey just for, you know, time's
sake, it opens up.

[]
Peter Wolf 5:17
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 5:24
You know, blah blah blah. Uh, check business.
Scroll down. Oh, this one looks pretty cool.
Tips, right? Same thing with the prompt does.
Copy to copilot. Um.
Same exact prompt.
About right, like if you go back and compare.
And then yeah, this is just rendering. I think this is with copilot. I
need to figure this out, but it redirects you back for the example
outputs, which I'm not even gonna focus on today. But yeah, we can clean
that up.
Come here.

[]
Peter Wolf 6:23
Scroll down, look, don't lie yet.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 6:24
Right.
Oh, sorry.

[]
Peter Wolf 6:26
Just because you see that there's that content we're supposed to fill
in, right? So we should, we should pick something to fill in. And this
one I don't think is good. This is a investment thing, right?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 6:37
Yeah, so I I was working on, I got sidetracked and there was a really
cool, you know, I was discussing this button and I got it working a
little bit just for time's sake. I was like, I can't focus on this, but
it was like every single prompt somehow.
Cloud code made it so that the user can fill in. There's for every
single prompt automatically through some type of code, right? It
formulates a text box, so it copies to copilot and the user gets shown a
little text box and they fill in the little text box with whatever
information.
And then it fills in the fillers for whatever prompt they're using, so
it's their own.

[]
Peter Wolf 7:19
Yes, you you know what we had, we had developed or I had developed some
prompts before where I started direction I was going was in the actually
in the in that in that custom prompt GPT.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 7:27
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 7:34
From the engineering GPT, I had rewritten them to say that the the first
I had rewritten them to say that the request for information should all
be at the at one place, kind of like this was right, not spread out
throughout the thing, but in one place where you just entered then what
I did.
It's changed a lot. You can say when the prompt runs, first thing you
should do is just ask me for the input. That way you don't have to find
where you put it to enter stuff. You just run it and it says, hey,
here's the can you give me this information? And if you give it to it,
great. And if you don't give it to it, then OK, then you don't.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:00
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:14
You don't use it, right? And it goes generic. I think. I think we should
think about at least going forward. I don't think we try and change all
the history of them, but when we're developing props, I think we should
develop them that way.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:17
Yeah, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah, it looks really good too. So like for example like this, like each
prompt via code like like an whatever, like an algorithm like detects
very simply. I've figured out like no changes of everything but it
right? Like fill in like the recent news information about me, right?

[]
Peter Wolf 8:44
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:46
Where the user would put stuff in here? Well, I did a few tests
yesterday and it would this right? Right now it's just popping up right
here.
What would happen was click user clicks here, you know, whatever. Let's
say they come across this prompt, copy to copilot. Well, then what
happens is this new little window, right? And it's like, please fill in.

[]
Peter Wolf 9:11
I mean, if they could do something like that, that would be, that would
be great, right? That's.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 9:15
Oh yeah, and then it formats and then it adds the prompt, but with the
user's inputs rather than them trying to grasp the entire prompt.

[]
Peter Wolf 9:21
Yeah, yeah. No, if it's possible to do that, that would be cool. That
would be cool. So for now we just say you have to enter the content,
right? Then obviously it depends on how you write the prompt. And as
soon as the prompts go in there, someone could take this prompt, copy
the prompt, change the prompt so that it has the specific.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 9:25
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 9:41
Information they want and just stored it right. It could be that
information would be the information they want, right? And then that
prompt would be saved that way or save a copy of the prompt with what
they want. Otherwise they enter the additional details they need, right?
So I think that's fine. Do me a favor, go back to where the prompts are
in the prompt library.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 9:43
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 10:01
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 10:08
Browse. I removed those images too.
Is to.

[]
Peter Wolf 10:11
Drill into any prompt. Um.
And we're going to go pick a couple of prompts so that we're going to go
find specific ones that fit with something more aligned with what we
want. Now go to marketing, go to departments, go to marketing.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 10:30
Department with business there.

[]
Peter Wolf 10:35
OK, so I want to analyze this, yeah.
Let's pick that third one down analyze industry trends.
Scroll down the right.
Go down on the right hand side.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 10:54
Oh, this is pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 10:56
Scroll the right hand side. Keep going.
Yeah, so that it that output. Can you can you double click on that
output? Like if you can't read that right? It's so small or something.
Yeah. And then is that even readable? Can you can you zoom inward? I can
see you zoom outward. Can you zoom inward? Oh wow, yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 11:14
Uh.

[]
Peter Wolf 11:21
Yeah, that's that's a problem, right?
It's not really viewable.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 11:29
I don't know why it's not. Why can I? I can't even like.

[]
Peter Wolf 11:33
Your **** looked like you could zoom out, but you couldn't zoom in like
it was already zoomed in.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 11:38
What the heck? You know, it's just a little stupid. I don't know why
this is even here. I mean, it's just like added.

[]
Peter Wolf 11:50
Alright, so we need to take note like there's gonna be things we're
gonna have to clean up and we're gonna have to stay really focused that.
Um.
Yeah, we're gonna have to stay really focused on what specific things we
want to clean up, but that's gonna be one of them, because right now
that's not really usable like it is, right? The font's too small or the
rendition or the rendering is is not. And over here, the same thing when
you get over there.
Well, over there it wasn't even output, right? It wasn't even showing.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 12:22
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 12:40
Did it fail? No, it triggered.
Oh, it didn't populate.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:01
That one did.

[]
Peter Wolf 13:01
Yeah, we're gonna have to find out if it's an issue because of the
prompt or because of something else so that we don't get one that's not
gonna work.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:12
Uh, just try this random.
Yeah, I'll try that again.
Now it worked. Weird. OK, analyze industry trends.

[]
Peter Wolf 13:46
Yes, I mean that all looks good, right? The that we need to repair and
then we need to figure out why it's so small in the other. But go go to
the prompt, execute the prompt. Does it look it's asking us for
something? It must, right?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:52
Yeah.
Yeah, turn on.

[]
Peter Wolf 14:02
My goal, my obstacles, my available time, my environment, yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 14:14
I mean it ask you, I mean, which is good.

[]
Peter Wolf 14:15
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the detailed instructions. Hold on, let me just
see what it says. Again, I don't want to use any one that's an
investment wall. We're going to have to find some good ones to use, but.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 14:22
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 14:34
Yeah.
OK. Let's go back over to the Ortfolio and let's, I mean to the prompts
and let's let's try and find some that fit good. Let's let's go to the
marketing first because I think that's where we'll find the.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 15:00
What do you want to shoot for like 5?

[]
Peter Wolf 15:02
I'm just saying I just want to find. I just want to find some that seem
like good titles to look at. Hold on. Set sentiment analysis, automate
e-mail sequence, brainstorm, build narrative flow.
Go up to the assess, go up a little bit, go up to assess the competitive
environment.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 15:20
Dulicates too.

[]
Peter Wolf 15:26
So it's competitive landscape. So hold on. Dr. Roll, expert market
research specialist and focus on. Yeah, right. He focus on e-commerce.
But that's where exactly one that should say it was, you know, asking
for inputs. Hey, Nick, you got to give me a second. I'll be right back,
OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 15:30
Uh.
Dropping that we don't know.
Yep, Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 20:50
Sorry, I had to put my trash up.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 20:53
No worries. I was just doing some digging too. So what we can do too for
the presentation is I just went over and favorited a few and we can just
keep all of them in favorites.

[]
Peter Wolf 21:01
OK.
And this.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 21:05
So I I just did a few, I just feel.

[]
Peter Wolf 21:06
Yeah, the only problem that industry trends once was like a what was it
a blogger or something? Click on that first one. Analyze industry
trends.
So.
OK, so that was that was good.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 21:35
You want me to send you these too? I can just send them in the chat.

[]
Peter Wolf 21:40
Or was I on industry areas of interest?
Yeah, um.
Again, this whole model of making the edits inside the thing is not
great, but.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 22:03
Yeah, I'm telling you what I what I had briefly for like that where I
had to switch up was really, really actually.

[]
Peter Wolf 22:07
Yeah.
I have to figure that back out, yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 22:13
Brings value kind of stuff, yeah.
This is good too. I I'm not sure what you're looking to, uh, present,
but like the.
Like create action plan is pretty cool, like the productivity stuff.
Adopt the role of an expert strategy. Your task is to help a user create
a comprehensive action plan template to achieve a specified goal within
a given time frame. Identify the goal and time frame upfront, blah blah
blah.
User my goal specify the goal to be achieved my timeframe response goal.

[]
Peter Wolf 22:53
Yeah, but really, are you gonna fill in all that **** down the bottom
there?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 22:58
Let's see when you paste it in. I think that's just how the prompt like
if we go here.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 23:19
And what we need to emphasize is all these. They can edit them and put
in the exact stuff they want. These are samples, right? So it won't
necessarily be that this is the way they're going to use the prompt.
This prompt is an idea. Then they come in here and they can they can
adjust it however they want.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 23:29
Yeah.
Yeah. So it's not it's, it's, yeah, it's starting a little bit more
information about you. What is your specific goal? What's your target?
This is like, this is so ID.

[]
Peter Wolf 23:46
OK, but at least it said. Yeah, but at least it said asking you what it
what for input. So hold on, let's let's say this as a completion
certificate organized.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 23:52
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 23:59
What's the time frame to achieve the goal? So let's let's put did it
automatically put that one and two down the bottom or do you do that?
OK, so then just put put that your goal is to is to launch a new
financial AI.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 24:06
I just did. No, I just did that.

[]
Peter Wolf 24:15
Um.
AI enablement hub.
And change it to Financial Operations, Financial Operations, AI
Enablement Hub and then wait and if AI Enablement Hub. Hold on Cole
launch Financial Operations, AI Enablement Hub for for.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 24:29
Rayite option.

[]
Peter Wolf 24:39
Fortune 500 companies.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 24:44
Fortune 500 companies.

[]
Peter Wolf 24:46
OK. And then down in two, say, yeah, you're you're looking to do that in
the next 90 days.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 24:57
Looking to do this.

[]
Peter Wolf 24:58
Yeah, I don't want AI adoption because we're this is, I'm trying to say
this would be us trying to get a plan for rolling out the hold on. We'll
also we'll put in the name of it. We'll call so large and then we can
copy this stuff and then use it just to paste it right in, right. So
gold large financial operations, AI enablement.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 25:04
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 25:18
In hub for Fortune 500 companies and then just put called comma, called
called um serrala.
Sarala Finos.
Put the OPS O like capitalized.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 25:40
Yes.

[]
Peter Wolf 25:41
You can take this the hyphen out, just put fin OPS and then fin OPS AI
Nexus capital NEXUS. Yeah, and then.
Um.
Hey, you know what? Let's let's add a little bit to this. So.
So hold one second. Hold on one second.
Hold on, I'm logging this on.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 26:23
Like I I love this kind of output. It's so.
Clear and direct to the user.
Like this is what piece of like this is.

[]
Peter Wolf 26:45
Hold on a second.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 26:46
Yeah.
And then the user can save this prompt if they want to retty much.

[]
Peter Wolf 27:28
Hold on a second, hold on.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 27:30
Yeah.
8.
Still there?

[]
Peter Wolf 31:03
Yeah, hold on. Sorry.
Can you cut that prompt out for me and justice send that to me?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 31:40
This one here.

[]
Peter Wolf 31:40
Just paste it in the chat.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 31:42
Yeah.
Get the.

[]
Peter Wolf 32:42
Yeah.
Yeah, so.
But I.
Take this and plug this in. The only problem is this is this is really
long and it doesn't look so good if you're.
You're putting in uh.
All this content, but it's got the prompt. Maybe we edit the prompt and
we.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 34:36
Yeah, I'll I'll I'll do this ready. So I'm gonna copy this.
Gonna do this.

[]
Peter Wolf 34:50
Just cut, cut and paste the whole thing out. It already has it in, yeah.
I don't think you need to edit anything. I think if you just cut it and
paste it the way it was, it would be fine.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 35:44
Let me know when you want me to scroll.

[]
Peter Wolf 35:47
Yep, Scroll down.
You go.
You go.
You go.
You go.
October, November, December, January 3090 days. Conduct customer
reporter enablement session.
Yeah, keep going. It's at the bottom. Accountability executive sponsor.
Yeah, that's OK. Isn't that great? Um.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 36:44
I'm I uh, let me try GT5. I don't know why I.

[]
Peter Wolf 37:01
Do me a favor, just cut and paste. Don't make any edits at all. Cut and
paste what I popped in there and just let it get.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 37:05
Yeah, yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 37:16
It may ask for a different set of follow-ups though.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 37:16
Yeah.
Oh well.
How to use is replace goal with. I'll go to the top. I'll just go up. I
still haven't sent your prompt yet.

[]
Peter Wolf 37:39
Yeah, no, I I you may not need to hold on.
So take, yeah, just execute my prompt now and just see what happens. Or
my input, yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 37:52
I mean, I love the templates. Templates are so nice when they're
properly, you know, they they work.

[]
Peter Wolf 37:57
It is structured.
See, the problem, what I expect is that they would, though they mean who
we're going to show this today, look at this and say, well ****, all the
complexities in what you added in, right? That's the part they don't
know. They don't know all that complexity to add that and so.
It is not predefined, so I'm feeling like that's not a great way to go
about this is to show all this extra content.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 38:42
No, I think like we talked about earlier, it's the pre. When they click
the prompt, they fill in regardless of whatever prompt that they pick.
Doesn't matter. There's no preset defined. Only a few prompts have this.
A little text box appears. How does that happen? Well.

[]
Peter Wolf 38:48
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 38:58
I I can't give you the the the techie terminology behind it, but I know
that it's possible because I've done it already and I've had the
conversation with the LLM. I've tested it first hand so when you they
click the prompt and it comes in. So this prompt here.

[]
Peter Wolf 38:59
Yeah.
Yeah, I understand. I know what you're saying. Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 39:15
Comes in, pops and it's just little text boxes and they fill it in and
then the prompt populates, but with the information that they have
filled in.

[]
Peter Wolf 39:24
Yep.
Yep.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 39:30
And it was great. And I got all wigged. I was like, I'm gonna try to do
this. And I was like, it's not worth it. We're here. Cool, cool.

[]
Peter Wolf 39:46
Yeah, I don't know if it's gonna take this long. I don't think we're
gonna go to the shrink.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 39:52
Can I turn off reasoning?

[]
Peter Wolf 39:53
No, no. Hold on, hold on. Just wait till it finishes now.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 39:58
Bill, second.
No, I think it's just the auto. It's probably like the auto or whatever.

[]
Peter Wolf 40:16
Looks like.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 40:16
Or.
OK.
Phase one. Why did this just?

[]
Peter Wolf 40:48
Yeah, it didn't look like it was ready to feed it out to you. It's still
working.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 40:52
Yeah, it is. I'm not gonna touch it now.

[]
Peter Wolf 40:54
All right, let's go back over. ****, let's go back over. I gotta pick
some props that are gonna be good. Show me the the saved ones you have
again.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 41:07
Um.

[]
Peter Wolf 41:10
And click the branch strategy.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 41:10
So yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 41:15
Hold on.
Scroll down on the left.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 41:29
No.
OK.

[]
Peter Wolf 41:36
Scroll down in the prompt or nothing said.
Keep going.
You don't pay stop.
Yeah, so we're we're only 15 minutes, 10 minutes. So we're not gonna
really get further than this. I think we're just gonna go about it here,
pull up these prompts.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 42:20
Let's let's go to the the business ones are good that we can grab a few.

[]
Peter Wolf 42:24
Yeah, the business one's got a bunch of investment framework stuff in
it. Analyze stock investments.
Duck gap and us conduct you a political risk.
We're going to create go to market strategy. Is that marketing or
business? See, this is the other thing. Some of these I looked at there,
there's they're just totally mismatched. They just.
Plopped them into business. They're really marketing, but click on the
go to marketing strategy second from the bottom.
Context top roll second code and log in.
Scroll down.
Kee going, Kee going, Kee going down to the inputs.
So briefly describe the new product or service. So take this one, run
this one, great go to market strategy and then take the first part of my
answer.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 43:33
Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 43:40
For the thin OS thing.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 43:44
I'm not gonna run with GBT 5. I'm gonna ride with whatever this model
is.
Oh, um.

[]
Peter Wolf 43:58
So just execute it and see what it does and then see if we can just O in
my.
OK, now take now take the response I have and plug that in just the
first part, not the 90 days.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 44:23
Just this.

[]
Peter Wolf 44:24
Yep.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 44:59
Let me know when the.

[]
Peter Wolf 45:03
Yeah.
Keep going.
Good girl.
You go.
Keep going.
Yep, so take that prompt and put it off. Save it off to the side where
you can easily get it where you don't have to change and cut out that
input and all. So save that prompt and then take the inputs I gave you
and save that somewhere so you can easily cut and paste it without
having to.
Fumble around and cut out the input or whatever, OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 45:41
Yeah, so let me let me clean this. So the favorites. So let's keep
create the conduct market or go to analyze industry trends. We don't
need this. Create your Twitter persona. We don't need.
International market research don't need create action plan template. I
think that's good to automate business, but develop a brand strategy.

[]
Peter Wolf 46:14
You know it's what was the one we just added? Create go to market
strategy. Was that it? What was the one we just did? OK, so again, just
take the take the info, yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 46:18
Yeah, so let's see how the. Yeah, yeah, let's see how this runs too for
because you can change.

[]
Peter Wolf 46:29
No 'cause that wasn't isn't the same one, is it?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 46:32
No, this is a different one, but I just want to test this with the web
too, because there's the web feature and this is a market research
question with solely and right, you have to click the web.
So.

[]
Peter Wolf 46:47
Yeah, but the web's about searching for stuff, right?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 46:58
This is the conduct market research.

[]
Peter Wolf 47:02
So the thing I'm going to focus on in this call is that we got a
structure and we got an integration, right? The content part is
something that can be built up. Probably doesn't have any content hardly
at all. Anyway, I'm going to talk about we're going to have category,
subcategory. We can talk about the the structure that the.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 47:05
Yeah.
Yep.
Try.

[]
Peter Wolf 47:22
HR is doing what they want. They want it to be department and and family
or whatever they call a group or team, how they want to handle it. Those
could be those could be adjusted in.
Yeah, take that and put it somewhere where it's gonna be easy for you to
cut it without.
I'm the kind of piecemealing or something.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 47:51
And then I could just have this U create again and I'll just yeah, I'll
be able to find it just, you know, when we're in copilot and I click
here, this'll populate.
And then I'll just easily be able to go to.
Go to market strategy, right? Yeah. And then just simply be able to come
here.
Oh.
And then run it and then just.
Is to them.
You want to get a couple more?

[]
Peter Wolf 48:45
Oh, yeah, a couple minutes. Let's just go. Yeah, let's go back and look
at them. Love you soon.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 48:48
And then I mean this is the prompt library if you wanna the admin where
you if you wanna talk about like the adding prompts.

[]
Peter Wolf 48:56
Yes, we'll show. We'll show about adding a prompt. Just Yep, it's got
structure for adding a prompt. You can either Add all that detail or not
Add all that detail, right? If you make it simple, you don't add detail,
it's just not gonna have it. But that's fine.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 49:06
Yep.
Can you can you give me a test prompt to make?

[]
Peter Wolf 49:14
Yeah, not, not, not in, not in 6 minutes. It's gonna put all that
content in there.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 49:15
Just to add.
Yeah, but another thing too, I'll just show you. So all of these are
edible. This works. Let's say that I wanted to export that prompt
exported just like that, and that's the entire prompt itself.
Right here everything that is in ID, title, department, subcategory,
description, content level.

[]
Peter Wolf 49:40
Yeah. And I would say likewise we could just say likewise we can upload
them that way too, right? So.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 49:47
Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 49:48
If we create a volume of prompts and what we're saying is we've curated
a bunch of prompts. We have prompts for the teams. Again, they're
moderate level prompts, but we can incorporate those. Yeah, so I'm not
going to worry about the content too much.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 50:03
No, I think the copilot button's really how we're how this integrates
and then how we plan on making it better with you know what we kind of
talked about this morning with the, you know, ease of use for.

[]
Peter Wolf 50:10
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 50:20
Any user and anybody can use it right, but they they need to fill. If
they want to use it perfectly, they can just simply fill it in or not.
They'll have the option to do so and it'll populate with their, you
know, it'll fill in the fillers and populate the prompt with.

[]
Peter Wolf 50:28
But.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 50:37
The users.

[]
Peter Wolf 50:38
And right now, at least the way we have it, is that you fill it in, it
becomes public. I guess something we could look at is if you wanted to
have prompts that were only to 1 user or something like that. Right now
we don't have that and I don't think prompt library prompt buddy has
that.
So I don't need to to promise to deliver anything more, but so right now
you have the ability to create. You have great favorites. We can mass
upload, we can download, we can, they can edit, they can.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 50:59
Yeah, that's what it'll be.

[]
Peter Wolf 51:10
Yeah, how about go, go to, go to that prompt that we that we had. I
don't know, because if you added something that you're gonna have to go
over to the other side, you're gonna have to approve it to come back. Is
that a hassle or can you do that without a problem?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 51:23
I can edit it right now actually. Uh, so maybe we can just pre fill it.

[]
Peter Wolf 51:28
That's what I was thinking.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 51:31
So go so it's go to where did the prompt admin go?
Oh ****.
What was it go?
Create.

[]
Peter Wolf 51:59
So you can't edit on the other side, you can only edit on the admin
side.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 52:02
Yep, Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 52:04
Um.
That's not good because because if the users that you're not going to go
to the user like when we roll this out and the user's got to once says
OK, this problem's pretty good, but I want to customize it to us, then
they can't edit it and save it.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 52:08
Why?
Right, right. That's what I was working on yesterday. So like, it
wouldn't make sense for the user to to what's in the prompt library to
mess with, right? Because then that would affect, let's call it
thousands of other users, because one user might find that.

[]
Peter Wolf 52:33
OK, but they could cop. Can they copy and can they copy an existing one
and edit it?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 52:38
No, they'll have the option within this button. The button populates.
This is solely for an individual user, and that user can click on the
prompt and customize it and edit it to however they want, and it won't
affect anything that's in here.

[]
Peter Wolf 52:53
Yeah, but are you saying the one time edit or or edit and save?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 52:58
They can edit and see, which is the vision that I had and I and I saw
and I just haven't had the time.

[]
Peter Wolf 53:03
So OK, so I'm not. I'm not following you. I want to make sure I'm clear
as we only got 3 minutes left. So if if right now I'm a user, I don't
have admin rights and I want to take a prompt that exists and I want to
edit the prompt and save the prompt so that I can put my specific
information in there.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 53:07
Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 53:19
How do I do that?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 53:21
You'd run it. I mean, right now you'd have to run it, blah blah blah.
And then I don't know why this is, but you can save this. You can save
this to the prompt library. Not right now with all what we have. We
don't have a feature for that, but you can save this.

[]
Peter Wolf 53:33
OK. Yeah.
OK, so then that's no, I need to make sure I'm talking about it right
now. So right now we we have it only that the admin can edit. We're
going to change that. It's going to be editable by the user. We'll
figure out how we control that or they can at least copy existing
prompts and they can then save them as unique so that that way if
there's a baseline prompt so.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 53:49
Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 54:01
Somebody else could use it. They don't disrupt all the others, but they
can copy an existing prompt, edit it, and save that prompt, right?
That's what we'll have to. We'll have to put in some functionality like
that, because if the user can't edit, it's not realistic to work. I
mean, it's not going to be a manageable function.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 54:10
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 54:16
And right now if they can prompt buddy, they could easily just add one,
right? It needed to go to approval at the prompt manager, prompt buddy
manager, but it was available. It would be available and they could edit
or create a new one. So we're going to have to have a function that
would copy because we're saying look, these are templates, they can edit
the templates.
And create new ones. So we'll say they don't edit the existing template,
they create a new template and then save that in its place. Or I guess
we could decide if they could edit. Again, it impacts everybody, but.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 54:49
Yeah, it would just be on their console. It would be when they have
access to the app, they can, you know, customize it and save it to,
which we can add later, right? It's that's not the issue, yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 55:03
Yep. No, that's what we're saying. Look, this is a baseline. We got the
connection. We'll figure it out. OK, All right, let's jump over, OK?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 55:06
Yeah.
Yeah. Did you send me the teams?

[]
Peter Wolf 55:16
Oh oh, I thought I already had it. Hold on.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 55:23
So I'll just walk with whatever while you're talking, I'll click through
everything and uh, just follow your lead here.

[]
Peter Wolf 55:27
Yeah, I'll give you guidance of what I'll give you guidance of what I
want you to go through.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 55:32
Oh.
What do you think looks cooler this? I think this color looks nice.

[]
Peter Wolf 55:37
Well, I show them back, show them back and forth. I wanna show the Uh
capability.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 55:41
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 55:48
OK, I just sent to your, uh, e-mail. OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 55:51
Yeah, alright, I'll join now.

[]
Peter Wolf 55:53
Yep.
