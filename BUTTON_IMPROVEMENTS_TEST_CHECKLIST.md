# ‚úÖ BUTTON IMPROVEMENTS TEST CHECKLIST

**Version:** 3.1.0
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Testing

---

## üìã Feature Summary

Three major improvements implemented to the floating button:

1. **Button State Indicator** - Visual feedback for sidecar state (idle/open/minimized)
2. **Quick Actions Context Menu** - Right-click, long-press, and Shift+Click menu
3. **Position Persistence with Snap** - Remember button position, snap to edges

## üß™ Test Checklist

### Feature 1: Button State Indicator

#### Visual States
- [ ] **Idle State** (when sidecar closed)
  - Button background: Purple gradient (`#667eea` to `#764ba2`)
  - Badge: Hidden
  - ARIA label: "Open SPARK AI Prompt Library"
  - Console log: Should show sidecar state changes

- [ ] **Open State** (when sidecar opened)
  - Button background: Green gradient (`#10b981` to `#059669`)
  - Badge: Hidden
  - ARIA label: "SPARK Prompt Library - Sidecar open"
  - Glow animation: Should pulse once when new prompt sent

- [ ] **Minimized State** (when sidecar minimized to tab)
  - Button background: Amber gradient (`#f59e0b` to `#d97706`)
  - Badge: Visible (12px orange dot, top-right corner)
  - ARIA label: "SPARK Prompt Library - Sidecar minimized (click to restore)"
  - Badge styling: 2px white border, subtle shadow

#### Behavior
- [ ] Button updates immediately when sidecar state changes
- [ ] Clicking button when minimized restores sidecar (not opens library)

- [ ] Badge has proper contrast for visibility
- [ ] Button remains keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators work correctly

---

### Feature 2: Quick Actions Context Menu

- [ ] Shadow: `0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`
- [ ] Minimum width: 200px
- [ ] Font: 14px system-ui
- [ ] Proper z-index (10001, above button's 10000)

#### Menu Items (5 total)
1. [ ] **üìö Open Library**
   - Opens SPARK library in new tab
   - Tab gets focus
   - Menu closes after click

2. [ ] **üëÅÔ∏è Show/Hide Sidecar**
   - Label changes based on state:
     - "üëÅÔ∏è Show Sidecar" when minimized
     - "üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Hide Sidecar" when open
   - Toggles between open and minimized states
   - Menu closes after click

3. [ ] **üîÑ Reset Position**
   - Moves button to default position (bottom: 24px, right: 24px)
   - Clears buttonPosition from localStorage
   - Console log confirms: "‚úì Button position reset to default"
   - Menu closes after click

4. [ ] **üóëÔ∏è Clear Saved Preferences**
   - Removes `spark_button_prefs` from localStorage
   - Removes `spark_sidecar_prefs` from localStorage
   - Resets all position/size variables
   - Shows alert: "SPARK preferences cleared! Refresh the page to see defaults."
   - Console log confirms: "‚úì All preferences cleared"
   - Menu closes after click

5. [ ] **‚ùì Help / Docs**
   - Shows alert with quick guide
   - Help text includes:
     - Floating button controls (Click, Drag, Right-click, Shift+Click)
     - Sidecar panel controls (Drag, Resize, Pin, Minimize, Close)
     - Button states (Purple, Green, Amber)
   - Alert is properly formatted
   - Menu closes after click

#### Menu Interaction
- [ ] Hover effect: Background changes to `#f3f4f6`
- [ ] Mouse leave: Background returns to transparent
- [ ] Items have borders except last one
- [ ] Clicking outside menu closes it (with 100ms delay)
- [ ] Clicking button while menu open doesn't re-trigger
- [ ] Only one menu can be open at a time

---

### Feature 3: Position Persistence with Snap

#### Saving Position
- [ ] Button position saved to `localStorage.spark_button_prefs` after drag
- [ ] Saved format: `{ left: number, top: number }`
- [ ] Console log confirms save: "‚úì Button position saved: {left: X, top: Y}"
- [ ] Position persists across page refreshes
- [ ] No save if button isn't dragged (click only)

#### Snap to Edge Behavior
- [ ] **Top Edge**: Snaps to 16px from top if within threshold
- [ ] **Bottom Edge**: Snaps to 16px from bottom if within threshold
- [ ] **Left Edge**: Snaps to 16px from left if within threshold
- [ ] **Right Edge**: Snaps to 16px from right if within threshold
- [ ] Snap threshold: 16px (CONFIG.snapEdgeThreshold)
- [ ] Snap animation: 200ms ease transition
- [ ] Snap happens on mouseup (after drag)

#### Viewport Constraints
- [ ] Button cannot be dragged off-screen left (min: 0px)
- [ ] Button cannot be dragged off-screen right (max: viewport width - button width)
- [ ] Button cannot be dragged off-screen top (min: 0px)
- [ ] Button cannot be dragged off-screen bottom (max: viewport height - button height)
- [ ] Constraints enforced during drag (real-time)

#### Position Loading
- [ ] Saved position applied on page load
- [ ] If no saved position: defaults to bottom: 24px, right: 24px
- [ ] Position uses `left` and `top` (not `right` and `bottom`) when restored
- [ ] Saved position works across browser sessions

#### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Multiple drags: Each saves correctly
- [ ] Reset position: Clears saved data and moves to default
- [ ] Clear preferences: Removes all localStorage, refreshes to defaults
- [ ] Drag distance < 5px: Treated as click, not drag (no position save)
- [ ] Window resize: Button stays within viewport bounds

#### Sidecar Tab Overlap Prevention
- [ ] Button doesn't overlap minimized tab (right edge)
- [ ] Both button and tab can coexist on screen
- [ ] Tab is 62px from right edge (safe zone)
- [ ] Button can be on left/top/bottom without conflict

---

## üé® Visual Polish Checks

### Transitions & Animations
- [ ] Background color transitions: 0.3s ease
- [ ] Box shadow transitions: 0.3s ease
- [ ] Snap position transitions: 0.2s ease (left/top)
- [ ] Badge appears/disappears smoothly
- [ ] No jarring visual jumps

### Brand Consistency
- [ ] Purple gradient matches SPARK brand (#667eea, #764ba2)
- [ ] Green state uses success colors (#10b981, #059669)
- [ ] Amber state uses warning colors (#f59e0b, #d97706)
- [ ] Menu styling matches modern UI (rounded, shadowed, clean)
- [ ] Font consistency: system-ui throughout

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Button works on 1920x1080 (desktop)
- [ ] Button works on 1366x768 (laptop)
- [ ] Button works on smaller viewports
- [ ] Drag constraints adapt to viewport size
- [ ] Menu positioning adapts to button location

---

- [ ] `spark_sidecar_prefs` key unchanged by button features
- [ ] Both keys cleared by "Clear Saved Preferences"
- [ ] Data format is valid JSON
- [ ] No console errors when loading/saving

### Console Logs
- [ ] Button position saved: `[Spark] ‚úì Button position saved: {left: X, top: Y}`
- [ ] Position reset: `[Spark] ‚úì Button position reset to default`
- [ ] Preferences cleared: `[Spark] ‚úì All preferences cleared`
- [ ] State changes logged (optional, via updateFloatingButtonUI)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid localStorage data doesn't crash
- [ ] Missing DOM elements handled gracefully
- [ ] Menu closes properly on all interactions
- [ ] Long-press timer cleans up correctly

### Performance
