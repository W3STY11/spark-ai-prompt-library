## Testing the API Directly

### Health Check:
```bash
curl https://spark-copilot-api.azurewebsites.net/api/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}`

### Search Test:
```bash
curl "https://spark-copilot-api.azurewebsites.net/api/searchPrompts?query=marketing"
```
Expected: JSON array with matching prompts

### Get Prompts Test:
```bash
curl "https://spark-copilot-api.azurewebsites.net/api/prompts?limit=5"
```
Expected: JSON object with 5 prompts

## Troubleshooting

### "App not found"
- Make sure you're logged in as NicholasWestburg@treasuryfinops.com
- Try refreshing Teams (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check the Apps section under "Built for your org"

### "@SPARK doesn't work in Copilot"
- Make sure Copilot is enabled for your tenant
- Try typing the full agent name: "@SPARK Prompts"
- Refresh the Copilot interface

### API timeouts
- First request may take 30-60 seconds (cold start)
- Subsequent requests should be faster
- Check Azure Function logs if issues persist

## Verification Commands

Run these to verify the deployment:

```bash
# Check app is published
pwsh -File enable-copilot-agent.ps1

# Check app is installed for user
pwsh -Command "Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'TeamsAppInstallation.ReadForUser' -NoWelcome; \
  \$me = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me'; \
  \$apps = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri \"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/\$(\$me.id)/teamwork/installedApps?\\`$expand=teamsApp\"; \
  \$apps.value | Where-Object { \$_.teamsApp.id -eq '5783104e-c216-4184-bd48-a49b283e24fd' } | Format-List"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Teams**: Open Teams and find SPARK Prompts in the Apps section
2. **Test in Copilot**: Use @SPARK commands in Copilot chat
3. **Verify API**: Test the API endpoints to ensure they respond
4. **Report Issues**: Check Azure Function logs if anything doesn't work
