Some reason now, whenever I join meetings, it always has my mic off and
my uh.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:01
Yeah.
Let me.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:04
Not sure why it does that, so I was just trying to get the from the last
fall.
So we can find out whether.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:15
Let me show you something real quick. I think you're gonna like just
briefly after sitting in on that meeting. So this is cope. This is just
solely the button.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:17
Hello.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:26
Can you see my screen?

[]
Peter Wolf 1:27
Yep.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:28
But check this out O.
I have the button like Norwal.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:34
Mhm.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:36
You can click it like normal. We'll go through this part. We'll just
simply I'll go through everything here. So this is 1 whatever. Same as
before, copy to copilot.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:47
Yeah, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Be
wolf.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:49
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 2:44
My contractors at Home Depot, they're gonna be calling me for a.
Credit card here for a purchase. Hold on a second.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 2:54
Yeah, no worries.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:29
OK, go ahead.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:33
So we copied that prompt in. Can you hear me?

[]
Peter Wolf 3:37
Yep.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:39
So new additions.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:41
Yep, I see it. Pin it. Yep.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:43
Minimize.
This changes color. I'll get to this in a minute. Prompts in there and
go back. You can now pin it and then go along your day tight.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:54
Hey, can you unpin it a second? Yeah, yeah, unpin it for a second.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:55
Can also drag.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:02
OK, I was just wondering, it looked like it's shifted, but that's great.
So you can pin it on the screen and you can move it around a different
spot. Awesome.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:06
Yeah, so this can move regardless. So it's called overlay. So with
overlay right when I try to type, I can't, but when I pin it, the
overlay is gone, but I can still move regardless. I can minimize.
And when it's minimized, that is orange. When it's open, it's green. So
let me show you another thing that I added. Let's just start.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:22
Yeah.
Awesome.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:33
With a clean conversation copilot.
This is pretty cool.
And this could get expanded on, right? So where's the button?
That might not be the right one.
I'm just gonna do this.
So we'll click on it.
Go over, grab the same prompt.
Copy to copilot. Boom, right? Pretty cool sidebar, but now.
This button here, if you right click, this is what you get.

[]
Peter Wolf 6:04
Hold one second. Hold one second.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 6:07
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 6:09
It was.
All right, so I'll go ahead and show you were right-clicking. Go ahead,
extra stuff.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 7:17
Yeah, so this is just a fresh screen.
Restart, right? We have the floating button like normal. So now you
right click and you get this.

[]
Peter Wolf 7:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Open library Hide sidecar reset.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 7:31
Yeah.
Take the prompt.

[]
Peter Wolf 7:34
Good.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 7:43
Turns green. Same thing right? Now if we want to pin it, minimize it,
turns orange and click reset position goes down to the bottom right.
Uh, show sidecar. It'll pop right up.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:00
Yeah.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:02
Hide side card. Hide the side card show.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:02
Nice.
Looks good, dude.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:07
So then you have help and docs. So this explains everything here. So
floating button, click open library or restore side card, drag move
button anywhere, right click.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:17
Hold on, what is that? Where is? Where was that? And oh, in the help
docs. OK, got you.

Nicholas Westburg 8:20
In the area called the action menu.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:23
Yeah, cool.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:25
So help docs and they'll just show up. So purple means it's idle closed.
Green means the sidecar's open. Amber I guess is the orange sidecar
minimized. So like if I.

[]
Peter Wolf 8:26
Awesome.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 8:41
close that it's minimized and if I I guess.
One second, I'm gonna try this updated version two. It just made me
which will.
Refresh the conversation that if a user wants to have a clear control A
control C.
Let's see this version.
Yeah, so this is pretty cool. So new conversation. So let's.

[]
Peter Wolf 9:42

for you the transcript from this morning.

[]
Peter Wolf 9:49

Peter Wolf 10:33
What is going on here?
Not what I want.
Well.
Oh.
That's frick.
OK.
So I asked for a transcript and it's got all these images in it. I don't
know why it's including the images, but I'm attaching this document.
What you want to do is focus on the topic about how do we migrate this
to.
To to the Microsoft environment. How do we host it? How do we manage it?
Right. It was a it was comments that Wilfred made and that Oliver made
and that I made about, you know, can this be on well in SharePoint? Can
it be on Teams? Can it be? Does it need a?
Does it need a web server? So that's what I need you to.
To hold on to, to incorporate or to ask. Um.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:12
Yeah, what I think is that the code's gonna be hosted through enterprise
GitHub account, which I think all developers have access to, right?

[]
Peter Wolf 13:21
Yeah, I don't know if we use that or not. Not all, not all companies use
that. I have no idea if we use it or or don't use it. There are other
repositories that companies use, so.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:27
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 13:33
That's what you need. You need to find out if if we didn't have a GitHub
repository, right? How would we host this code? Where would we put it?
What's the? Here we go. Oh, process workshop.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 13:37
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 13:49

then I'll get back to you in a few minutes. OK. They should. My next
call shouldn't take me more. I mean, maybe till 12, so 25 minutes. OK.
