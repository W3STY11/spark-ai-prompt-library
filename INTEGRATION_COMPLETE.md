## Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Fixed

### Problem:
The "Copy to Copilot" buttons were only copying to clipboard - they didn't automatically insert into Copilot.

### Solution:
1. **Updated BrowsePage.jsx** - Added BroadcastChannel support to send prompts cross-tab
2. **Updated ViewPage.jsx** - Added BroadcastChannel support to send prompts cross-tab
3. **Created Tampermonkey Script** - Beautiful draggable button with auto-insert functionality
4. **Rebuilt Production** - Fresh build with all changes
5. **Restarted Server** - Running on port 8080 with new code
