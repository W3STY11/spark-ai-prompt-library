## 📊 COMPARISON TO EXPECTED (2,530 Prompts)

You mentioned expecting 2,530 prompts from Notion, but we found 2,424.

**Difference**: 106 prompts

**Possible Reasons**:
1. Notion export may have filtered out drafts/unpublished
2. HTML export may have excluded certain status types
3. Some prompts may be in Notion but not exported
4. Duplicate detection may have removed some

**Recommendation**:
- Check Notion database for "Pending" or "Draft" status prompts
- Verify export settings included all statuses
- Run Notion API import again if needed
